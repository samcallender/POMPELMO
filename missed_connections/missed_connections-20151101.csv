I told you that I was an actor and you mentioned catching up with your friend who is an actress. You left with your group and said goodbye and good luck. I felt like an idiot for not at least asking whether I would see you around. You were very present and receptive in your environment and a relaxed person to talk to. I have almost no hope of hearing from you on this, but I thought I would give it a shot. Reply to this and I would love to see you again.Jason"

I remember you being kind of angry and bossy and impatient, not at me, just in general, like the job was driving you crazy. I could understand, given the circumstances and the ghetto, thuggish crowd you mostly deal with there (on that particular day I saw you, a black man with dreads in the elevator threatened to ""shoot up the place"" because he didn't want to wait on line anymore and you called Security on him... another time I went a 20 something female accused some 70 year old woman of ""flirting with her man"" just because the older lady said excuse me as they formed a queue/line, and the young woman then threatened to beat her up. Ridiculous stuff like that.. You were one of the most intense people I've ever met...You were impeccably dressed in a navy blue suit, a fit white male with dark, dark brown hair and beautiful cheekbones to match intensely blue eyes. There's nothing sexier than a man bossin' a woman around. I need a man like that- one who is 'in charge' and in touch with his masculinity. Naturally dominant, no props needed... Let me stroke that hair and those cheekbones and melt you down... I'm a swf (white), 5 ft 7, 35 years old, with long auburn colored hair, curvy where it counts (back and front), very busty, green eyes.

Other than that, I'm attractive, athletic, funnier than the funniest person you know so far, a childlike sense of imagination, love to travel, have a great career going and am pretty well settled in life. I'm 32 years old and the only thing I'm missing is someone to share it with. Maybe I'll find that person here?I tend to be attracted to someone who has the same sort of personality and who is pretty laid back.It's tough to date with this disability though, I feel like that's an automatic dealbreaker for most people.

I know you heard it SAT nite when I said I'll write you a note on Craigslist.I am the gentleman who stopped you on the sidewalk SAT night and said you look fantastic. I quickly introduced myself and told you my name is Chris.Please let me talk about the context of meeting you. I was on my way to the subway, coming from a party over on 2nd Avenue. I spotted you walking toward the intersection at 4th Avenue and 8th street (St. Marks Place).My eyes were stunned initially. I just liked your appearance so much. As you came to the corner the light was still red, and there were men on either side of you. Instantly I wondered, are you with either of them? Is one of them a boyfriend? When the light changed green, I saw you step away from them and breeze past me. I was almost dizzy with pleasure at seeing you jaunt by. But I snapped myself out of it in one second and instinctively turned around and walked after you. You were moving along at a pretty good clip. I almost had to sprint to catch up. What was on my mind? Three things. One --I wanted to compliment you on how great you looked, in a nice way that makes your comfortable. Two - I wanted to make it obvious I was intrigued by you and wanted to see you again. Three - tell you what I was going to do to try and make that happen (post a note to you here).I also want you to know Stef, WHY ..I am so interested. You are exactly, precisely my ""type"". Seeing you was not just taking in your prettiness, but your whole aura. Your bouncy upbeat cheerful energy. Your chic fashion style. I related to your presence with enthusiasm. Obviously I'm a little older than you, but, so what, que sera. I'm single. You're single. Life is what it is. We're in New York. Why not see what happens?I would luv to see you again. How can we do it? Any way that is comfortable for you. Lunch. Dinner. Drinks. Coffee? You name it. Hey the worst that can happen is that we don't; click. But nothing ventured nothing gained. I think we might. Because when I stopped you to say hello, even tho we only spoke for 10 seconds, you had a nice tone, gracious and friendly. So about me. I'm single, never marred. An entrepreneur in the entertainment and media world. A published writer. Former radio and TV personality. Fun, friendly, outgoing person. Like to do things. Have adventures. Enjoy life.Nuff said? Please email back thru here and tell me how we can get together soon. That would delight. Have a great dayWarmly, Chris"

The dorky pants, and the sparkly shoes that looked too big for you. But the way you moved. You had so much verve, so much kitsch, so much energy. My eyes were glued to you all night...but circumstances made it difficult to connect. I probably got too far into my head about it, but, in trying to be respectful of my friend, when I probably didn't need to be, I missed out on you. But, hey! It's cool. See you on the dancefloor. Or write me. Matthew"

I was in Berlin 9/15-17 or so, so sometime then. I was just walking around and I asked you for directions, because I was truly confused about where to go. I then noticed how cute you are and asked you where you're from. You said you were from Chile. But you seemed to speak English with an American accent. You had long, tight, curly blond hair in a pony tail, and huge blue eyes. I llloooooovvvveeee your hair sooooo much. Quite unique.

I am very young at heart, however, and I don't mind sharing you. I don't normally go for younger guys either, you would be the first time I did. Check out this song (on Spotify), it's how I feel about you... let's sing this together... ""Beautiful Birds"", by CANDIDATE, on one of my favorite albums of all time, Nuada.Or better yet, ""In Love With Love"" by Gregory Page. I wish I would have talked to you more.

Cautiously optimistic, I realize that even this attempt has its implausible flaws... As it draws attention to myself, as I shamelessly solicit. *blush*Though a tad bit uncomfortable, I still strive forward with a keen sense of confidence... After all, it is said ""Nothing ventured, nothing gained.""At this point in time, I choose to remain safely hidden in the ""shadows"" by keeping my identity anonymous like most everyone else!!Yes, bold and yet still fragile... I choose to protect and shield myself from those that might criticize. *cringe*Making it my mission, I hope to strike a chord... So I'm asking for your help, from those of you that either casually/carefully browse and peruse through the ""missed connection's"" section.I'm hoping that with a bit of luck, that perhaps there is an individual somewhere out there who will recognize who I'm addressing and bring this post to his attention. ...Someone who might actually know ""Mr. So&So"" and please pass this message along to him!! *fingers crossed*Here's a hint:Stowed away from the limelight, for some time (at least to my knowledge) ...That was, until recently featured on BIP (for just a blip) this past summer. I'm searching for a certain someone who just returned to NYC (welcome back!!) from the city of Houston. Though not native born to the ""Lone Star,"" a citizen of this country. And even way before, living in ""Magic City,"" for a time prior to landing among the cosmos of ""Space City.""... He had uprooted himself from his hometown, nestled along the southern, sandy shores of ""Strong Island."" Granted, none of this includes his time away at college.Though this clue may be seem vague to some, it could well be an obvious riddle to others... I've only shared here what most others may already publicly know-- hence, I'm no private eye or worst yet!! *gulp!!*As an aside... It should be so simple, right?! At least it should seem so, that in this modern day and age when the use of technology can close gaps, bridge the distances and connect us... Happens everyday, in this fast pace of life... Isolated to ourselves, just strangers passing glances.. When no one slows down for a moment to catch their breath, to pause or reflect... When most days, we're just too busy, always rushing and caught up in our own hectic-chaos. *sigh*Well with eyes wide open, I venture to engage in genuine communication, that's authentic and honest-- And with only the best of intentions!! Perhaps hard to believe, given this platform of introductions... Truth be told, I wish to see where this path may lead-- Even if this undertaking results in only creating a strong foundation in which to build a solid friendship that will last through the ages!! *smile*So with all that being said, here's to hoping that something positive will come from this somewhat ""shady"" attempt of finding that one single needle in the proverbial haystack of life!! *wink*If you are the recipient, to whom this post is directed, I apologize for my timing... If you should take the time to reply during this very exciting pre 2015 World Series, 111th edition (and don't mind the distraction??) ...Please respond with book title in subject, from summer reading while franchising with others ""south of the border,"" in paradise.Thanks to all, for hearing me out... I rest my case.Cheers and peace out!!"

Some of us are better at hiding what we feel are flaws are and some of us whine and cry and show everyone our flaws. Striving for perfection is boring. Embracing your madness and the things that might make you feel ugly or unloved, is sometimes exactly what you need to do, to overcome the turmoil inside yourself. Figure out how to make your flaws work for you, and let others see how you have turned a lemon into lemonade. Because they are in the same boat as you, everyone of them. And they will look up to you. I am a person, who loves flaws (certain ones). It's the largest reason I fell deeply in love with someone years ago. It was not all the good things about him, it was the flaws I saw inside of him. And he beats himself up over these flaws on a daily basis whirl-winding into a deep depression at times and then beating himself up for being depressed about it in the first place. I know for damn sure I'm not perfect.I'd like to know, because I know you see them, what are the flaws you see in me? Don't hold back. What are the flaws you hate most in yourself? And do you think they can be fixed? If so, how?"

I am very sorry. It was Friday night, October 23rd, probably going into Saturday, October 24th. You were on the subway with your friend (another girl), but you caught my eye. I'm pretty sure I was never so infatuated in my life. Your laugh, your black leather jacket, your jeans, just your general kindness... I still can't get it out of my head. I followed you around like a little puppy-dog, totally lost in the moment, no idea where I was, other than that I was with you. Your friend left, looking at your longingly as she either transferred to another subway or got off (I'm not sure), giving you the, ""Will-you-be-ok?""-eyes, and you gave her the ""it's-ok-he's-harmless""-nod. I am sorry to even think that I took advantage of your trust, that I tried to buy your company. I was stupid, not in my right mind, and thought that I was hot shit in my blue suede shoes, navy jacket, slim fit khaki pants, pink shirt with white skinny tie. Little did I know how much it would eat away at me, the fact that we had a special moment in time, and I ruined it with such a cheap question...""I hate that it has to come to this, but how about a hundred dollars? Two hundred? Three?"" I literally wish I could go back in time and punch myself in the face so hard. I think you slapped me...I'm not sure. But I totally deserved it. If I had to reach down really deeply into my soul and think about it, I'd say that we both enjoyed that time together...the seemingly eternal yet infinitesimal space in time that paralleled the opening and closing of the subway doors, going up the escalator and my crouching down, to see you kind of amused, kind of scared... I am sorry to have scared you. I am sorry I was an asshole. I hope that you forgive me. And if, by some miracle, you actually see this or your friend that was with us sees this and passes it on to you, and if, by an even greater miracle, you reply to it, I just want to say this: if I could've changed any one thing, instead of things ending the way they did, I would've finished by asking you, ""Well, how about you let me cook you and your kids breakfast? I'm stranded, can crash on your floor, and will be up early to go get some eggs and pancakes and it'll be good; I'm great with kids."" You would've said, ""That is very sweet, but I will have to take a raincheck on that one."" We would've smiled longingly, as I hugged you goodbye.I am sorry. All the flowers in the world would not do justice to the type of apology I have for you, and one day, I hope that this message is somehow conveyed to you, the positive karmic vibrations sent through the universe SOMEhow... either through the kindness of another or a very lucky day, your kids doing really well in school (because I pray for them and you now), or you winning the lottery...SOMEhow...and I hope that even if you will most likely never know the good fortune may have occurred due to my prayers, you will feel happy enough to forgive all those that have wronged you or upset you, all in that one moment."

By the time we actually had a chance to talk, I was already about 2 stations away from my stop. Would have loved to continue the conversation if there was more time. Maybe we can analyze Harry Potter some more or watch the Star Wars episodes since I'm into that too. I know this is Craigslist, but I'm not on any of those apps about missed connections or dating. Looking for one less app to occupy my time, so hope this will do the trick."

280,5293205100,there is this van...,2015-10-30 19:27,/mnh/mis/5293205100.html,mnh,...,"","There is this strange van parked outside my house. It has been there for two days now, I don't know who owns it, and it has all this stuff inside it (metal poles that look like they could be shelving or something) so I know you probably didn't leave it, but still, it reminds me of a fight that broke out in my house about six months ago and how I said I would have to move, and I do.I mean I really do have to move, and that's the problem, because I don't have enough cash to move right now (yes I found another job, but the stress of the whole fight, etc... is screwing with me enough that it is interfering with me at work :( HATE THAT!) so I now have to go out and find a new job (again) while I figure out a way to keep my shit together enough to save up enough cash to get a place by myself so I NEVER have to deal with another situation like that again. Never, never, never, never, never again.And there's this cargo van outside, a nice little light grey cargo van, (that I have never seen before and I vaguely recall saying something about a cargo van, but it is all hazy) just sitting there, innocently, almost like it is begging me to break one of the windows and Chicago punch it and drive away, and it reminded me of you. It makes me wonder if I told you how I would react six months after the big ass fight. How I would become almost delusionally fixated on you and that one moment where I totally lost my shit, and hence, am now, six months later, looking for a savior. I mean I know myself, I know what happens six months after the big stress event, and I know what the six months in between are like. So, maybe you came back and tried to talk to me about it and I was a total bitch, can't remember..... strange. I'm guessing that's what happened. (were you stupid enough to come back to my house after that fight? Didn't we have to lock my live in landlord in the psych ward because of that fight?) You hate me now for it all, I am totally sure of it.So, did you park a light grey cargo van with metal stuff in it outside my house? If so, can I crash on your couch while I pull my shit together, because I have a lot of unanswered questions and am a total nut case? (plus, my live in landlord has finally figured out that I hate him and started crying, I guess he figured out that he totally violated his gay feminist morals or something)Ummmmm, reminder, my dog has a Napoleon complex, but my roommates love him and will take care of him if you don't really want to deal with it."

I'm trying to ascertain if you meet my standards. You stated than insecure men misuse the term ""gold digger"", but you didn't give a proper definition of the term. Would you be willing to post what you imagine a ""gold diggers"" wish list might be? Then, in contrast, explain how your wish list differs? I am of the opinion that being insecure might not preclude someone from being able to identify a ""gold digger"". Do you disagree with my opinion on that? Also, do the words ""insecure"" and ""un-secure"" mean the same thing to you? I can imagine a scenario where a woman might be attracted to an insecure man if she thinks he comes from wealth, then breaks it off if she realizes he is less well off than she initially imagined. Would a gold digger admit she broke it off over financial reasons, or would she say she broke it off because he was insecure? Other than monetary reasons, what would cause a woman who hates insecure men, to date one? Do gold diggers ever misuse the term insecure? Is it safe to assume you are a banker or CEO, since you claim to know so much about them as a group? Or, are you making assumptions about a group you know little about? You seem to be claiming to have high standards. Are those moral and ethical standards, or just financial standards. I tested rather high at reading comprehension, so I understand some of the frustration on display in your post. I also have received email from the loser looking for an ""arrangement with a non-pro"". I also want to go off on him, and explain what M4W means.

My perfect dinosaur would be someone late 20s to early 30s. Asian, Indian (yes, I know technically Indians are Asian), Guyanese, or Caucasian. Someone who is open minded, laid back, emotionally stable, who absolutely believes in monogamy. Someone who is comfortable in their own skin, down-to-earth, hilarious, thoughtful, nostalgic, and is mostly an open book. Oh and vital: be young at heart.

343,5291935091,I threw a dried plum at your face on the L train. - m4w,2015-10-29 23:39,/brk/mis/5291935091.html,brk,m4w,Brooklyn bound L Train,"I sat down directly across from you, and you noticed I was munching on some dried fruit in a little plastic box. Or did you see me coming? You immediately opened your mouth to suggest I throw a snack into it, as if you were waiting for me to arrive. As if we were old buds. I noticed the beauty of your lips and your eyes, and though your gesture clearly signaled that you wanted me to toss a prune across the isle and into your mouth, I couldn't help but notice the erotic undertones of a woman displaying an upturned chin with mouth agape. Not that I misinterpreted what you were getting at--I knew a delicious sweet treat of dehydrated stonefruit was what you desired, nor did I take any particularly erotic pleasure from the moment. It was quite lovely and storgic. Like we were young playmates, blissfully ignorant of the blights of humanity surrounding us.Of course, I was more than happy to oblige. How often does one get such a happy opportunity?The first throw was too direct and lacked the necessary loft to come anywhere near your mouth. I was surprised and embarrassed by my lack of tossing skill because I'm typically quite good at body and object awareness. What good is a man who can't accurately lob a succulent dulcet bonbon of nature into a fair maiden's waiting maw? It landed impotent in your lap. You were carry a stack of loose (drawing?) paper, and I was worried I would sully the top page with a smear of reduced fructose.Eager to correct my error and avoid ruining your paper, I readied another dried fruit morsel and awaited your signal. This time, unfortunately, I overcompensated, throwing too hard: the dried plum flew passed your head smacking the advertisement behind you and rolling to the subway floor. I don't blame you for wanting to call it quits after this latest trajectory fiasco. Afterall, I just narrowly missed your face with a rapidly moving gooey projectile. I wanted to redeem myself, claiming that the third time is a charm, hoping to tersely imply that I now had a handle on the extremes of the throwing gamut and would be more able to find the mean of the two, ie. your mouth. But you probably rightfully protested, and we ceased our play. I really should have thrown underhand. I don't know what I was thinking.You ate the one that landed in your lap and said, ""Thank you for indulging me.""I said I was happy to indulge you. Then we sat there, with so many wonderful unknowns hovering about us. If I'd have had more energy, I might have engaged you in conversation about your day, but I'd been making conversation all day long, and I was tired of it. It didn't seem necessary. I felt as if we could have simply sat together without speaking, and been content.Who knows. It doesn't matter. I had a good time. You made the world feel like home and you made my night. You obliterated for a few moments all the world's machinations and alienations with your simple, playful gesture. Thank you."

While I was peeing you did a bump of cocaine next to me and all I could think was ""I'm about to leave and this guy's just getting started."" You flushed the urinal and squeezed past me (there's not a lot of room in there), touching my butt along the way. You said, ""damn, you got a fat ass."" Which is true, I do, and I like when people call it as such. (I've got years of Southern cooking under my belt, I come by it honestly.) Amused by you and attracted to you I leaned into you, and we made out, you grabbing my dick and then fingering my asshole. After a few minutes of this someone tried to come into the bathroom, at which point I figured it was time to stop. You didn't want to stop yet. I am a bottom and I could tell you like playing the top, but I'm a lot bigger than you (6', 250lbs) so I was able to easily remove your hand from my pants and casually eject you from the bathroom, hopefully without betraying that in bed you would get to call the shots with my aforementioned fat ass. ;) You went off to talk to your friends, and I talked to mine, and I ended up leaving shortly after - I was on my way out anyway.But that was fun, stranger.

Been trying to catch a glimpse of your cock in the urinals and to drop hints every now and then. Not sure if you're actually interested. As we were heading down the stairs today, I finally got the courage to ask if we've met before. You didn't take my bait. Maybe you truly don't remember. We met at a video store a couple avenues away from our school. I was too shy. You grabbed your crotch and motioned toward one of the booths. I don't know how I didn't see you slip out of the store. Anyway, there was this one guy stroking off in one of the booths. I kept on thinking it was you. I really wanted to suck your cock. That desire hasn't gone away. Maybe it has for you though? The thing is, I'm partnered, long term and long distance. If you're okay with keeping it casual and discreet, it would be great to drag you into a secluded toilet stall somewhere in our school's building and give you a mind-blowing BJ. Or, maybe you can meet me at my apt, about a 15 min walk away from school.If you happen to see this, feel free to email me and tell me what you want, things that maybe you can't tell me in person in the library. I know this is a risk since we know each other's identity in some way. Hopefully we can keep this quiet? Or, maybe you can just hit me up at the library again, maybe tomorrow.

I can't read those stories without thinking about you--and I wonder if you even remember. I still look for you on the only IM service we ever used, but since I created it as a safe place for only us to chat, I'll be deleting that account at the end of the year. Things change, life keeps stumbling forward, leaving different ones of us in the dust on the edge of our memories. I get that.I do hope to one day bump into you again, either online or (however unlikely) in person. Your pleasant camaraderie over the last few years is sorely missed.

If you are - then literally wtf dude?First of all - the staring? Chill your eyeballs bro. I felt those things boring a hole in my cranium before I even noticed you. I get it, ya know? I was looking good yesterday. I snoozed through 8 alarms and stumbled out of bed 45 minutes late. I haphazardly slammed some makeup across my face and threw my dirty hair into a bun. I overdressed because I just moved back from California and I really don't understand the weather here anymore. Later in the day I got caught in a substantial downpour that ignited my frizz filled Jew fro and turned my bangs into much shorter, curlier bangs than I'd ever imagined was possible. Pair all of that with a little late 20's PMS induced acne and the general wear and tear of a long day and damn. I get it. I was looking fly as fuck dude. So I first noticed you when your dumb eyes were laser cutting into my face. I'm like 70% of the way through Into Thin Air so shit's getting good. I'm surprised anything tore me away from that book but it's difficult to ignore someone trying to move things with their brain à la Matilda or whatever you were doing. I caught your eyes and immediately felt something. It was mostly fear of impending doom because you were FIXATED but also you're not bad looking. Whatever. I'm lonely. I noticed that for some reason you had strapped your backpack across your chest like an overanxious high school freshman OR like Jon Krakauer in the best selling non-fiction book I mentioned was sitting in my lap. Suuuuuup fate?But you ruined it. Listen, I'm 28 years old and spend arguably too much time on my cell phone like most of my generation. This experience means that I am skilled in both taking a stealth picture (flash must be off, noise silenced, body slightly reclined so it doesn't seem like your phone's at a weird angle) and recognizing when someone is taking one of me. I appreciate your ingenuity and technique for sure: you rotated your phone and took multiple pictures in succession. To the untrained eye it maybe looked like you were wiping the screen or learning to juggle in a very inefficient way, but not me babe. I know you took a picture and I am NOT happy about it. Seriously? What part of my sweat soaked, rain drenched, frizz banged, and makeup-less appearance got you going? What did you need to commemorate so badly? It was creepy and weird (and sure I've done it like once) but you made me feel really uncomfortable after a long day. Not cool. But also you have really nice brown eyes and I've been single for a while. Tell me what random organizing thing you were lugging around and maybe we can get together and take pictures together or something."

It was a culmination of three years worth of regret, embarrassed, disappointment, and rejection. The notion of you is great but at this point its just a dream...a forbidden fantasy. I guess the main reason why I'm writing here (when I vowed I wouldn't) is to clarify who I am for you. Your depiction of me speaks more about you than me and I realized that last night.I was scared I was gonna die of a heart attack or stroke. It was at that moment I realized I should be ashamed of myself. I have soooo much to be thankful for and so much going for myself and I shouldn't have let my emotions take me hostage like that. I layed beside my rock and thought about him. You have no idea how silly I felt but I'm glad I went through it. I have a different outlook on life. Shit, I'm good now. Lol Better than I've been in a while. You've purposefully gone out of your way to hurt me which is fine. Mission accomplished. What you don't understand is that I will be fine. I am fine. I have no dependency issues and my inner resolve and strength is far more in control than you seem to realize. I've never done drugs. NEVER. I never prostituted my body and never will. I value ""me"" too much for that. I have not been and never will be suicidal. I'm too STRONG for that. I have too much left to do on this earth to leave in such a fashion. I'm raising one of the most difficult kids ever BUT I think he will be one of the greatest humans to walk this planet. He deserves better from me and I vowed last night to give it to him.I know you saw me this morning and was surprised to see how well I'm keeping it together. You thought you broke me. No ma'am. After waking up this morning, there was a sense of relief and inner piece that I've been missing since falling in LOVE with you. Unfortunately for me but fortunately for you that chapter has ended and that door has been closed. I'm relieved and you're happy and that's all that matter. I'm not relieved you belong to another, I'm happy I've been freed from emotional purgatory. You freed me on the 18th and I thank you. I'm happy for you. It looked amazing. You're amazing and he's a lucky man to have you.Now its time I find my prince or princess :-) and move on with my life. I'm excited about the possibilities. Doesn't hurt that I plan on screwing around a little bit before I marry. Don't worry, my screwing around consists of 1-2 people and I'll be sure to use a condom. Lol. I say all of that to say this, I'm thankful to have met you. Your presence in my life has caused me to fall to inner depths that I didn't know existed. And I think your presence will cause me to rise to heights that I thought were unimaginable. I now understand what love is and how precious it is. I will not make this mistake twice. Thank you. Godspeed"

Long hair, glasses, me. You were super casual in a preppy summer outfit: blue shirt with olive shorts? Fabric sneakers, blue messenger bag with leather trim? I don't recall the outfit well because I was confused by what just happened. You were in your late 20s or early 30s? Brunette whiteboy. Shortly after I sat down, a dime appeared OUT OF NOWHERE in the seat to my left. It clattered a bit against the hard plastic, which is why you looked up from your book. Our eyes met & you shrugged, going back to your book as if it was the most normal thing. DUDE, A DIME JUST APPEARED OUT OF THIN AIR!!!

You were a shy girl, I was a brash guy...We were meant for each other. I don't know where this mystical lady is now, but she stole my heart. She probably is married to a Calvin Klein underwear model, living in a 1 bedroom apartment in a suburban city with a french toy poodle named Fred.

Since I will never be able to express this to him personally, just putting it out to the universe. Not looking for reply's or answers... just looking for closure. A relationship that will never be. A love that will never be felt. A friendship that will be lost forever. A moment in time that will never be recaptured. I can only hope that he finds happiness and love, just as I can only hope to find the same. All I would like to have is my heart back. They say that love doesn't get jealous, doesn't get vindictive, love always forgives, love endures through all test of time. Being in love is not just about the good times, its about all the times. Love doesn't hurt, it heals. The concept of two people being in love is what we all want. It's what humans crave. I read these ad's and sometimes find myself feeling bad for others. I hear the hurt, I feel the pain but often wonder why we can't all find ourselves letting go of situations that don't work. You can't blame another for your unhappiness, because ultimately we decide our own happiness. When all you have are dreams, memories, and heartache for the one that wasn't the one to begin with, then its all just an illusion. We have all hurt, and we have all hurt others. I've come to the conclusion, that me personally, I never want to hurt another person again. I don't like being jealous, I don't like judging others, and hope that for some reading this, maybe just maybe will change they way they think.Although there will always be a place in my heart for this person, I know that I cannot spend another minute wishing, praying, that my situation will change. It won't. So I'm taking a stand. My heart will be free and so will yours!Be happy... Love with your whole being and never let one bad situation destroy your hope and faith in finding the one.Good luck and be well."

The distance between us didn't help, if we were closer I would have totally atleast most likely lol said ..uuuuhh.... good morning..... or for goodness sakes smiled SMH... I apologize I was in my thoughts and music, your appearance and energy just so happen to be able to confuse and distract the hell out of me .

Distance between Borough hall and 14th .It look like you had a camera bag and I believe I had something noticeable for you to maybe call out varafying its you during a response .....

These males will deliberately attempt to place women on the defensive in order to prey upon their conceivably latent insecurities. These males have nothing to offer the women in question so they seek out insecure women or berate, harass and abuse the women, because it irritates them that she is uninterested in someone ""like him"", a male who is alll alone and bored. How dare she!!!! He has nothing to do but troll and overanalyze, because his life is unfulfilled and he is bored and alone. Is it too difficult to understand why she has zero interest in him and why he is all alone? Look in the mirror and stop blaming her for your own shortcomings. It's all you, baby. If you could find a woman who is willing to settle for less, then you should have no time leftover between work, school, hobbies, social life and family (one or more), to contact women with unsolicited replies which do not meet the request of their ads. Your contact is all about YOUR shortcomings.If you lack the family and friends with whom to share experiences or discuss your problems, then find a therapist, or seek a non-profit social worker or read self-help books if you can't afford the cost, but don't you dare attempt to dump your baggage and issues onto me, a stranger, who has nothing to do with the root cause of what ails you. Maybe if you actually focused on being grateful and giving back when you're able, you'd actually start to feel better about yourself and not have the need to put down others, because you'll no longer be miserable. You're just looking for an excuse that has you running from yourself or from holding yourself accountable for all that ails you and how you are going to fix it. That's why you are attempting to distract and deter someone who is focused on what she wants and needs for positive experiences and progress in her own life.You run to a stranger whose ads you claim you can't stand, a strangerwith whom you possess next to no compatibility, rather than face your demons and free yourself for a better life. Think about that. Think about why you hate yourself that much and what you've done to fix it. Fix you instead of chasing after strangers who are leading their own lives. Stop running and deflecting. Focus on you and what works for your life and how you can improve itjust like I do and the people with whom I am compatible. We don't have hatred or envy of anyone, because it will not improve our lives one bit. You have one life to lead. That is your own. Hold yourself accountable for your choices and stop with the unsolicted replies that keep you running and from admitting to and facing your own demons and issues.I'm quite certain that no one here is a perfect person. Most people aren't perfect. Someone who is sending unsolicited cl email replies is certainly showing clear signs of being lost, alone and in need of help.Rather than sending those unsolicated cl relay replies, get the help you need. Become content in your own life so what women disinterested in you do with their lives makes no difference to you. You should be too busy working on yourself to hurt or bring pain to anyone. You should be too focused on what you want out of life to judge with unsolicated cl relay replies in regard to ad(s) to which you clearly don't meet the request(s), ads of a complete stranger whose real life you know nothing about. If any of those males had any real game or anything going on in their lives they'd be interesting to themselves, but they're just as boring to themselves as they are to women, because they have nothing going on in their lives and nothing to offer. So these males then attempt to place HER on the defensive for trying to make sense of a site such as this one and to use it in a way which makes logical sense to her. It pisses them off that she refuses to fall for the nonsense online where some males with no game or life make up stuff in regard to themselves to appear impressive or capable in some way even if they have nothing to offer her. There's a very bizarre dynamic online where certain males feel entitled to receive the attention and interest of women who in real life would likely not give them the time of day, so then when she attempts to raise the bar for such a lack of standards to see what he's really about, this pisses him off. The reality is that her type of guy in real life would NOT be perturbed by it, he's used to, and even compelled or intrigued by it. The further irony at a site such as this one is that the anonymous ""cl relay email guys"" don't realize that they've lost nothing if they're incompatible, so there's nothing to discuss. This is the general premise that had prompted this ad in the first place. I'm simply taken aback by how many males here don't have enough going on in their lives for themselves outside of anyone else, with or without friends, women, goals, fill in the blanks, it needn't be specific, but enough to be sufficiently fulfilled that there is NEVER a reason to contact a woman in regard to her ad(s) if it's to share anything less than pleasant or a reply which has nothing to do with meeting the request of the ad(s). This is basic common sense. If the content of a woman's ad suggests incompatibility, there's no need for debate, because there's no loss. But, instead there are males here based upon pent up aggression and anger who choose to let out the disappointmnt from their past associations and deflect it onto her when she has nothing to do with why you have the opinions you do of women or other people. That's your business, not hers!!! Find what you're looking for and leave her out of it. That's the point that should be obvious. It's when you get ticked off at a stranger based on the content of her ads which have nothing to do with you that she's compelled to say, ""What a minute, what's really going on here? What are these random strangers really saying when the content of your ad(s) has triggered them in some way based upon THEIR past which has them feeling that they should be taking it out on you as a complete stranger to them?"" Why are those guys not going to the source, rather than contacting a stranger? That's the point.I'm speaking specifically of the ""cl relay email guys"" who reply for no logical or constructive purpose.It pisses them off to see a woman who sets the rules for her own life whether it's work time or play time. It's HER life and it's HER choice. It pisses them off to see a woman who could not care less about what the majority have to say, because she is leading her life, and she knows what makes sense to her. This is what matters. Mind you that there are men here who have complimented my ads and appreciate that I place screeners on men just as I would in real life. They're obviously not the males to say, ""This is Craiglist"" to suggest that I can't place standards here. Says who? It's MY choice. I never ever said the contents of my ads are meant to appeal to everyone. The notion would be totally arrogant, just like the notion that any ad placed means it MUST BE for YOU. It's not logical.The premise is to each his own, live and let live and if it's not for you, find what's right for you and leave me out of it. Personal preferences and type of relationships or friendships which appeal to me is none of your business and vice versa. I simply find it ironic when a complete stranger via cl relay believes he should have a say. It's not your place. Focus on your life and the lives of those you care about. It's not your place to try to figure me out, figure yourself out. If you don't have anyone special in your life, find someone special. Focus your energies on things which matter, not to contact someone who you can tell by the content of her ad is incompatible to you on enough levels to trigger you negatively in some signficant way. Come on, we're are all adults here. You must realize what you're doing if you are honest with yourself. If a woman requires worthwhile feedback, she will take it to family and friends of her circle who she can trust based upon the good choices they've made for their lives, not some sap at CL who is abusing women, because he's bored, without a life, and shouting via his unsolicited replies that he's begging for attention, any attention, even if it's from a woman who clearly has placed an ad which spells out that he does not qualify!!! Imagine that, the kind of troll illustrated above thinks that HIS opinion should matter to a complete stranger!!!! The woman who has standards and logic for good reason is the woman they insist should be listening to what THEY have to say, the males who are attempting to disparage her or place her on the defensive. I don't know WHO you think will fall for your baloney, but it certainly is NOT a smart woman who leads her life. If you do not meet her standards, too bad for you. She just has more time to take better care of herself and become a better woman until she meets the kind of man who has it makes sense to free up her time.These offenders are so insecure the best they can do is call a woman ""names"", and abuse or harass her, because it is THEY who are powerless. They feel like nothing around such a woman, because she dismisses them. They will misuse the word ""gold digger"" as a buzz word to any woman who sets any standards for men, standards that well-raised men had already been taught in their upbringing or within decent circles of society. In reality this is not the definition of gold digger by any means. They create their own definition as a way to attempt to disparage a woman. Shame on you.One day you will have a daughter or niece and a male will abuse her just as you have abused other women. That's the karma you create when you disrespect women for living life on their terms and placing standards on THIER LIVES.It amazes me how some males are so insecure and have nothing going on for themselves so they troll others and attempt to delve into another's business even if they're strangers who have never met and with whom they hold no compatibility. The logic is just so disturbing.. but then again I suppose these males must be mentally ill and either don't see it or are so tortured by it, because they feel helpless and powerless in life, so they take it out on a woman of self-esteem who sets the rules for HER life.Rather than accept the reality of individuals online having differences on par with individuals in real life, and accepting these differences as basic incompatibility, OR a reason to step up, these trolls will instead attack and malign the woman and project their own shortcomings onto her. Real men have always been inspired by women. Men in my circle in real life are by-in-large, educated individuals who've had a good upbringing, good family, goals for their present and future, and financial stability. These men don't have any issues with me. These men all love me. Meanwhile, the trolls here seek to malign a woman they don't know based upon the standards she places in ads as a form of screener. This pisses them off enough to ""hate"" her although she is honestly just seeking contacts with whom she is compatible, no differently than she does in real life. She's not hating on anyone and honestly doesn't owe anyone an explanation. Women have become more and more capable and independent outside of the home as a result of more education and delaying marriage while desiring discovery and developing self-awareness and wholeness outside of men. This is a good thing. It means women are more secure and have more to contribute to their relationships as friends, colleagues, professionals, daughters, significant others, wives and mothers. This does not change the importance of men and their role to women unless males wish to be irrelevant to women and unimportant to themselves. Men who are secure in themselves as men, know their capabilities, have clear goals and plans for their futures, or already are financially secure and career-oriented. Such men find it second nature to treat women well as a basic form of respect and sociology. A smart women knows to choose such a man by default. A reasonable man doesn't expect a woman to be exactly like him. She's not looking to emasculate him and take over his role IF he knows how to fulfill it. She is who she is and that's all well and good. He's not looking for her to be someone she's not in order to win general favor. He's grateful for her femininity and all of the positive qualities which accompany it whether they have common interests as professionals or in their industries or not. This is a matter of personal taste in terms of what a man and woman find appealing in the dynamic of a relationship. This can also change over time as additional mutual trust is earned and their roles evolve.Eliminate the need for a man to care for a woman and a family and you eliminate some of the best qualities of women as loyal, caring, nurturing and supportive. The less a man is masculine in his interaction with a woman, the more masculine she will become until or unless there is a masculine man in her presence or life.A man who is in touch with the dance of men and women (le pas de deux) realizes that men are more simple and women have more layers and are more complicated (insofar as needs for dating and relationships). He realizes that men and women have differences and he accepts and embraces those differences. There's no point to attack a woman simply because you fail to live up to her standards. For every man who believes good men don't exist, there are other men who are very well aware that great men exist and are quite common in their circle. Once a woman has known a great man, then it's next to impossible to settle for anything less. The irony here is that the males who attack and berate, these males call a woman of standards who screens men as a ""man-hater"" when in fact most of what I've learned about males has come from men in my life who have been like big brothers to me and generally cared about me to tell me what's really going on. It is these successful men in my real life who have told me that no man is my charity case.If he can't treat me like a lady, and respect me in a way which meets my standards, then say bbye.The problem at this site is that the insecure males want something they can't have. Otherwise they wouldn't bother to contact me although it's perfectly clear that I have less than zero interest in them, other than to point out how pathetic they are for making me so important to continue to contact me despite my lack of respect for them. You see, I don't consider these types of males as men. In real life it doesn't need to get ""dirty"" or vicious. Men are rejected and screened all of the time. The powerful and successful men in society learn young that it's life. If they're smart, they become more powerful, more successful, and more charming where it's next to impossible for a woman to not take interest. It's only the trolls who are whining to me via cl relay replies, not the CEO's, ibankers, attorneys, hedge fund mgrs, RE developers, or any males with real control over their lives who actually adore or appreciate women. I always get along splendidly with the succcessful and educated man who doesn't harbor negative energies toward women. Why do you think this is? They have set standards for almost their entire lives so it's natural to understand a woman who would screen and set standards for hers and what makes sense in life, particularly at a site such as this one. Just because a website chooses to perpetuate the worst stereotypes of men and women (cheaters, alcoholics, drug addicts, sex addicts, swingers, hookers, the mentally ill, the illiterate, the ignorant..) doesn't make it the reality for all who visit."

I will take your trust, love, turn upside down what you believe in these things and leave you hurt, possibly broken. but you will not do the same to another, will not want another to know such a thing because you are burdened with a fully functioning conscience. so you will withdraw, recover if you will on your own, heal alone. poor unfortunate bastard ; you have no ""affliction"" to fall back on, so withdraw, bury yourself in the pain, used and left alone with it. so any of you when hurt turn it inward, god bless you! you would be mortified to do this to another, never use as a license to turn it outward, continue their cycle of pain to others. you will survive it, but also remain loving caring and stronger. they can live in their cycle of pain to others.fuck them, I've been robbed, yet don't steal, cheated on, never do the same, left for dead for no good reason only to be the""savior"" to others. able to find joy in my life on my own, despite the light from love they try to extinguish, I still see the color of love. they do not define all others as you know. they only know shades of grey, we are all the colors love can be. can manage to eat, bath, work and pay bills just fine but have you believe a conscience is to heavy to carry? fuck that bullshit excuse to use others as medication, therapy for their own selfish needs. that is the king of ""addictions""""disorders"" and ""afflictions"" SELFISHNESS caring for others will get us up on our darkest days, not letting them down, leaving them alone will make us rise from the ashes, our love for others will heal us. not therapy,drugs or using another human being."

""Are you okay?"" you asked, and I looked up with a very insusciant smile and said ""Oh yeah!"" and you hugged me and I hugged back, ignoring your sub-meridian.But when the job was done I slipped away without saying goodbye and ever since I've been on watch for a message from you because I know you wanted this week to pick up where last week left off - with you feeling noticed by me and feeling special, like there was something I wanted from you that I was willing to make a show and an effort for. I know you notice and feel some sadness when you don't get that from me. And I still fucking empathize with those feelings of yours.But what this most plainly suggests is that the excitement of these nuptual plans has already peaked, and you're now thinking about what you'll be losing, or already have lost. And one the biggest and saddest losses for you I reckon is my devotion, my attention, and my affection.This is how you are about everything. You want something so badly and make someone in your life who does care about you furnish that wanted thing. But soon after you get it you forget the thing and your wanting, and go back to what you always do - wanting broad social interaction and attention & approval from in as many ways and from as many novel sources as possible.And so I know what's going to happen; we will come together again - because you eventually will not be able to stand your new status quo (with mister supplicating steady provider who thinks he can contain and satisfy you, and therefore must not know you at all) - And that's the difference; I do know you. I see it all and though it keeps me at a distance sometimes, I still empathize and never judge you or ever give you any ultimatums.And we will come together again because even if I act insusciant at times you do have a very special space in my whole life and my whole being. Even though your fan club shit pisses me off I know we have a connection distinct from any of that, and I know you know it too. A primal, pherimone, inner-child, ancestral affinity. But I make you work for it sometimes too. That's why your smoke-and mirrors efforts to conceal your aging don't affect my feelings for you (though I know the naked truth better than all except that one guy who bought you that fucking ring).So what I'm saying is, despite this impasse and its limiting effects on our communication and candor, I'm anticipating being deep inside you again, feeling quite certain it will happen and also quite certain of the unique gasp from the bottom of your soul and spirit that will be emitted when that time comes."

But maybe the ""real world"" we have to live in, and the selves we now struggle to stay faithful to, at least give me emotions to feel. It is still better than feeling nothing at all. Even with so much of our lives separate and isolated by our boundries, you knew me better than anyone. You are still my best friend and the most tender lover I will ever know."

She's just a regular girl full of insecurities and EGADS, baggage up the wazoo. She's not your epitome of good looks nor is she your epitome of intelligence. She's just a girl who decided to destroy her body with excessive junk food, just a girl who found a box of red clown hair dye and decided to give it a whirl, who cut her pubic hair like curls right on top of her shoulders, who lives on Craigslist posting up one ad after another hoping to get laid by multiple men (doesn't matter who. just stick it in), who, again, according to my significant other was stalking him in Barnes and Nobles. Apparently, she had a crazy look on her face (which i've seen with my own eyes) and bulging fat pockets gone astray. What else are you going to lie about, K-lown? If you want to see her in action go to the Bryant Park (5th Ave and 47th St) Barnes and Nobles in Manhattan on certain days. Please go on the days she wears her special black dress and please tell her to take it off (not in the dirty way as she wishes everybody would want her to), but in the--go wear something more appropriate for your body type manner. Thank you! Oh, and make sure it's no raining. She hates the rain."

There was one seat left outside, at your table, and I sat down with you and your friend. The moment we started talking I didn't want to go back inside to hang out with my friends. I was so taken with you all I wanted to do was be near you. I was nervous and completely comfortable at the same time. The rest of the city practically melted away and I just wanted to talk to you. You gave a homeless man who passed by a dollar and a cigarette. My friends were inside talking to this guy Tim who we went to college with, and who ended up being a friend of yours. We sat outside until everyone was ready to go, and then went to your friend's apartment. It was on Ludlow, next to The Living Room, and had a pink gate. We stayed downstairs to wait for your friend to come back with beer while everyone went upstairs.Upstairs, your other friend played his movie while smoking cigarettes and joking about my friend who had fallen asleep in the recliner. You sat back and your arm brushed against mine. I pretended not to feel it, but had to turn my head away from you and shut my eyes for a few seconds. Then, when I went to cross my legs, my boot hit your knee and you winced in pain. My face went red, and you assured me it didn't hurt. I sank back into the couch and our arms touched again. Neither of us moved.The night went into morning. My friend suggested we go, and everyone else agreed. I ran after your cab and got your number. You went back to Brooklyn with your friends, I went back to the Upper East Side with mine.I was so nervous to call you, and when I tried a few days later and the number was out of service! I either put it in my phone wrong, or you never wanted to see me again. Either way, I was crushed.All I know about you is that your name is Mike and I think you were from Northport and worked in a restaurant. The rest is either forgotten or we never talked about it. You could be married with ten kids now for all I know, but I just wanted to let you know that the night we hung out still pops into my head every now and then and I wish it had turned out differently."

There every single fucking day at 10am. Hanging around the steam till almost noon. Never ever ever ever using the gym equipment. You just badger men for sex in the steam room. Like a 2year old or a broken record, you harass every guy to fuck you or let you suck their cocks. You're like a fucking parody of a self help book....this is not what they mean when they say find what you want and don't give up. If you see this, I'm the gym equipment saying we are a missed connection. Fifteen minutes a day of us connecting could make changes in your life. No longer would you be the troll! No longer would you need to badger men for sex or scoop them up when all the average men have left for work and they're looking for ""last-call larry"". 15 minutes a day with the gym equipment and you could be moved from ""Trollish Tito"" to ""good enough Gary"". And maybe even consider 30-45 minutes....then you'd be ""hunky Javier"". Just a suggestion. I miss you. Sincerely,The gym equipment at New York sports club. "

When you came to run on the treadmill next to me, I could barely contain myself. Unfortunately, I couldn't look over at you since you were right next to me. You finally went back to the elliptical and looked back at me with those sexy eyes one more time before you came back over to your boyfriend and gave him a kiss. He is one hell of a lucky guy to be able to be with you everyday. Thanks for making my workouts something to look forward to."

Music production, designing web sites, and reading are my passions. I stand five feet and six inches tall with short blond hair, blue eyes and fair completion. I am average weight for my height and work hard to be healthy and strong. I am a non-smoker and social drinker. I am looking for the same.I pride myself in knowing how to treat a girl right in and out of the bedroom. I can be sweet, gentle, and very romantic but not the LEAST BIT afraid of taking you in a manly fashion and having my way with you when I know it's time, for hours on end.I'm a sarcastic dork and I don't try to deny it one bit! If you are one too, then you get extra points and I'll probably call you cute. You don't have to like any of the things I do, just have something that makes you all tingly inside to tell me about. I really dig learning about all sorts of new stuff, but if we happen to be geniuses about all the same things...well damn, maybe we're made for each other then! You should be single, Caucasian, and female (no negotiation on this one haha). I'm not particular when it comes to height or hair color but if left to my own devices I tend to seek out athletic blondes close to my height.Sound to good to be true? Prove me wrong. ;-) We could start off casual, and if it turns into something big, then awesome for us. If not, no worries. ;-) I'm looking for a companion one day, but until I find her (maybe you), I want to have some fun looking!"
