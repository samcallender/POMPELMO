Just before the turnstiles, you almost ran me over, rushing to be first at the NJ Transit ticket machine. A few minutes later, we are standing next to each other down by the escalator on the platform, waiting for the train to Manhattan. Our eyes met multiple times, but my brain was too dead after a long flight to strike up a conversation. It took a railway worker's announcement for us to utter the first few words. You asked me something, and I only managed to say two or three words. A few moments later, we are sitting in the waiting area across from each other, and I glanced at you a few times, unable to keep my eyes off of you. Before boarding the train, we stood next to each other on the platform. You went to sit on the upper deck, I stayed downstairs. I saw you one more time, then lost you at Penn Station. You: dark blond / light brunette hair, light color trench coat, grey jacket, knit sweater, scarf, brown pants, light brown shoes, brown leather duffel bag, maroon handbag, a red leather document briefcase, and a white iPhone 5c with pink ear phones.

Have you noticed that?But here's one thought I have when you say such things to me at thispoint; What would your fiance think if he knew you were still feelingthis way and speaking this way to me? You see, its the same deceit andduplicity that has been there for the last six years, when ourrelationship (or affair) began.He was back there all along - ""Oh we never see each other!"" ""He doesn'ttouch me!"" ""I don't think he cares!"" ""I want to leave but I have nowhereto go!"" ""If I told him I'm in love with you he'd kick me out of thehouse! You don't want me to be homeless, do you?""And now even on your wedding day or on your honeymoon if he were to ask,""So you never slept with him?"" You would say, ""No! he's just a friend! He might have wanted to but I told him I was already in a relationshipwith you!"" Or some such lying thing. . .You and I know the truth, and that makes your wedding a lie. But I'msupposed to play along and think its sweet that you have this secret withhim because it flatters me???And it goes even farther; How do I know I'm the only one that has aspecial status in secret from your schmucky soon-to-be hubby? I don't. He shouldn't trust you, why should I?And so your entreaties of love and our unique bond seem like a fuckinghussle and really just a vampire attack, which I've experienced many timesbefore with you.

I remember you being kind of angry and bossy and impatient, not at me, just in general, like the job was driving you crazy. I could understand, given the circumstances and the ghetto, thuggish crowd you mostly deal with there (on that particular day I saw you, a black man with dreads in the elevator threatened to ""shoot up the place"" because he didn't want to wait on line anymore and you called Security on him... another time I went a 20 something female accused some 70 year old woman of ""flirting with her man"" just because the older lady said excuse me as they formed a queue/line, and the young woman then threatened to beat her up. Ridiculous stuff like that.. You were one of the most intense people I've ever met...You were impeccably dressed in a navy blue suit, a fit white male with dark, dark brown hair and beautiful cheekbones to match intensely blue eyes. There's nothing sexier than a man bossin' a woman around. I need a man like that- one who is 'in charge' and in touch with his masculinity. Naturally dominant, no props needed... Let me stroke that hair and those cheekbones and melt you down...

I wanted the time to think about those questions because I have never been one to just jump into things. I don't know if you were ok with the request for that time. I'm afraid that you weren't ok with that, then again, maybe you were/are and I'm just paranoid - it's not like I never get paranoid (I'm just honest about my paranoia)I know what I would like to have but I don't know if you would like the same thing. I don't know if what I would like is possible and I have to be realistic and say probably not.Are you really back? I think I'd be happy if you said yes.

I am about 5'11"" tall, average build and work in a law firm in Manhattan.I know people have told me not to put too much detail into this post, but I want to begin by being HONEST about my circumstances, what I am looking for, and HOPEFULLY someone out there will have either been in a similar situation, or at least be able to empathize to the point of (I hope) a cup of coffee, at least.First of all about AGE? Doesnt matter.. all my life was in relationships with my age.. yet last gf was 21 and I am late 50s. We were together as a couple for 3 years. She was tired of guys her age who only wanted her for the physical, then left her. She wanted someone more Mature who would truly take time to get to know her as a person. Someone Older who would listen to her thoughts, feelings, respect, care for her.And romantically, someone more Mature who would take time for warmth, affection, Tenderness. Someone who would go slow---hold hands, cuddle, be gentle.That is why it worked.. and why it PROVES when it comes to age it is truly just a number. For feelings are Universal at any age.So if you are in my age range, fine. But if younger, doesnt matter!Either way!OK so that being said, here goes (LOL):Some time ago I lost many things at once:1) Girlfriend of 7 years (she broke up);2) Best male friends of 20 years (they did not die but went their own way)3) My car4) My job (D0NT WORRY I have a good job now)5) And my own place (share for now --divorced for 10 years now, can prove it and saving to get OWN place again in 4 months).Subsequent to all those losses, I did make 1 true friend (platonic) and was in a relationship with a woman for 1-1/2 years, which ended a few months ago (she moved out of NY).At this point, I am seeking a friend to talk to, to do things with.I AM SO TIRED of doing everything ALONE.. it HURTS!Id like to meet a pleasant, warm female companion to share things with.. movies, walks, anything we have in common.I enjoy bowling, outdoors, LOVE nature.. fresh air, trees, and music.Love All kinds of music pretty much.. books, moviesBut most especially just being with a special person.It is NOT easy to be ALONE in NY. And despite the fact I have recovered pretty much from what I pointed out in the 5 points above, being alone again now. Just feels empty.. especially around the holidays!I put this ad in BOTH the platonic section AND the dating section because I am OPEN to both friendship AND romance.I happen to be a very Affectionate person, love to hug, cuddle? I love it.Ultimately, I am looking for a woman I can CHERISH, treasure for her mind, heart and soul? a woman who wants a man who will be LOYAL, TRUSTING, who will stand by her no matter what.. who will be her best friend, her soulmate.A man who she can turn to at all times.. to lean on for strength, emotional support. Who will be tender, gentle, and loving.If ure looking for that too.. not a man who plays games but a man who can be DEVOTED, WARM, loving, a good listener.. empathic.. im here!I am college educated, and fix computers on the side.. so if u need any help with your computer, feel free to ask.OK that's about it.

Not that there'sanything wrong with that, but why on earth would a woman who has anythingto offer a guy give it away for nothing to some horny toad just because he asks?Second, if she is all that then wouldn't she already have one or more guys lined upto casually ""get busy"" if she was ""into"" that sort of thing?Why would many guys here then seek to demean or flag a woman who wants more?It's her life to lead after all, not yours. Being sarcastic, offensive, rude, or flagging won't change her opinion. She doesn't care what you think, nor should she. Third, if a guy doesn't have anything to offer her then why should she take an interest?It's not like having sex or fooling around is considered a form of charity.Fourth, we personally aren't into casual sex or casual fooling around. We think thatit's something meant for your boyfriend or husband. Otherwise how would it be special?We don't see how it could feel right if the guy wasn't our boyfriend or husband.Fifth, if it's a matter of being horny, then okay, we don't consider ourselves to be prudes,but why wouldn't we just masturbate? We of course know our body better than anyone else.Six, if/when we do feel open to fool around on a rare occasion where there isn't a certain relationship, and instead of considering a guy we already know well as a friend, we would be open to consider a guy here, that is IF he is open, doesn't require sex, is perfectly finewith respecting whatever it is we find comfortable, and is willing to provide a contribution that would seem almost impossible to refuse, because it could practically be applied to thingswhich would have us feel appreciated no differently than when we have long-term boyfriends or if we had husbands, then it all comes down to safety.Seven, if one was open to fool around and she has options, why would she consider a site thatguys imply is only about sex and for sex since this means that it's statistically more dangerousin terms of contracting a venereal disease?Eight, we all know that the likelihood of people using Saran Wrap, dental dams or condoms (latex) is extremely rare in general and especially at a site like this where males seem to be so focused on sex and freely expressing their need for sex, so why would someone want to hookupwith a guy who has no value for his life and would play Russian roulette with it?Nine, if someone is willing to provide test results to prove that he's disease free, this is no proof of his activities since he's last been tested.Ten, if a man is willing to provide new test results taken right before you consider fooling around, then what proof is there that he's been abstinent thereafter should you choose to engage such activities again?How many people even if they have been testedin the not too distant past with documentation to prove it, are actually getting tested again immediately before the possibility of sexual activity? Very few.To summarize, our disinterest in hookups doesn't mean that we are lesbian, dislike men or are fat and ugly. In fact, it's the opposite. The above only confirms why certain women aren't sleeping around. It's about value. Yes, we get sexually aroused like everyone else, but we exhibit self-control. The value for our lives and the respect we have for it and ourselves serve as remindersthat we are priceless.AMEN.",40.78019889999999,-73.94600439999999,2015-11-19 22:53:39.296378,2015-11-19 22:53:39.296378,Google Places API

But this is more about letting it off my chest than about finding you. (although nothing is impossible)It was a late Thursday night. I remember because it was Fashion's Night Out. A night of fashion, fun, frugal spending and freebies. I was on my way home, waiting for the G train, which is exceptionally slow past midnight. Me, unconsciously biting my nails. You, probably thinking of something to say to me. You eventually tell me that I shouldn't bite my nails. I didn't even know I was being watched until that point. Its a bad habit of mine and I was hoping to get a free manicure but missed out. I turn and look at you to see a tall man in an all black suit and tie. My mind immediately thinks of security guards. I dont really remember our conversation but i'm pretty sure I hid my nails and rambled about my bad habit and the manicure I was hoping to get. You ask me about my night, I tell you about my night on the town (macys gave out free moscato!), my few celebrity sightings, and my love for fashion in general. I believe the train came by this point. I rushed on to grab my favorite seat by a window. You walk toward me and ask if you can sit in the seat across from me. I couldn't tell if you were joking or serious. So I just laugh it off and continue the conversation.At eye level I finally get a good look at you. I remember thinking you were very handsome and clean cut. I finally ask you about the suit. But first I decided to guess. Loss prevention at century 21? You laugh and say no. I believe you said you were a buyer for a boutique. Of course I ask for details, I just assumed because you were tall that you would be in a field like security. But lo and behold, you were a buyer for a boutique!!! My stop was coming up but I wanted to continue talking to you. So I waited until the last second but you stood as well and we were getting off at the same stop. I asked if you lived in the area and you said yes. Once we were outside you held your hand out for a handshake and told me your name. I remember thinking that you were so formal, since I didn't usually come across guys like that. I shook your hand and told you my name. You ask for my number and I didn't hesitate even though you were a stranger. I had already decided that you were a nice guy by your actions. As we were about to part ways you tell me not to forget your name and I said I wont. I even repeat it to reassure you.I haven't forgotten this encounter even though it was 3 years ago. As I was walking home I remember hoping that you would text or call the next day because I was a freshman in college with no job and my phone bill was not paid. I knew it would be cutting off in a few days.Unfortunately, I didn't hear from you before my phone cut off. A few months passed and i'm focusing on school. With my full time school schedule, i'm unable to work and was without a cell phone for that whole time.But one day, (I kid you not I am not making this up), while on the bus with my mom, my phone starts to ring. It took me a while to realize that it was my phone ringing, because I hadn't paid my bill and I was on a bus full of people, so I thought it was someone else's. I pick up the phone even though it was an unrecognizable number, and guess who it is?! Once you say your name I immediately remember that night on the train. Because you told me not to forget your name, I never forgot it.I'm so shocked that you were calling and that my phone was receiving a call, that I don't even know what to say. I remember you saying that you thought I had given you a wrong number. Then I explained the whole phone cutting off thing. I don't remember the conversation after that, but we did make plans eventually. We never actually met up, but our last conversation was while I was working on an art project at a gallery. You called me but you sounded busy. We were at different points in our lives. Me being 18 and you in your late 20s, it just wasn't working out. Even with that weird moment when my phone started receiving calls out of the blue.To this day I always think about you. All the what ifs. This is just a reminder not to let missed connections get away. I remember your name and also your birthday. During our first conversation on the train, I felt an instant connection. I probably asked you when your birthday was. When I told you mine you said you had the same birthday as me, but I didn't believe you at first. Even recalling this right now, Im trying to figure out why it had to be a missed connection. Maybe when the time is right we will connect again. Side note : You lived in my area but we never bumped into each other again. Maybe you moved away. Hopefully you are like me, and you check this section sometime in the future.

Tall with a lanky frame. You have brown eyes and wavy brown hair. You live somewhere in New York and I'm fairly certain that your name is Mike. I've never met you before in my life, but I had a dream about you last night.I'm an artist and apparently so are you. In my dream, we were walking around with a very large group of people, painting and postering the corridors of an empty college somewhere. Each time one of us had finished our section of a wall or door, the entire group would then gather to the location of the piece to marvel at the finished product. Towards the end of the dream, I came upon the most fantastic work of all. The wall itself was huge and on this enormous workspace, the artist had affixed many colorful posters with ornate decals and all sorts of interesting things. A lot of care went into this piece and I stood there captivated by the wall as I waited for everyone else to regroup.Once the entire crowd had gathered to inspect the wall, all of these nice, artsy, friendly people suddenly became an angry mob. They all began booing in unison and shouting mean things about the subject matter. Most of the posters contained anti-war sentiments and a lot of writing that spoke in condemnation of the Iraq War.That's when I saw you. You pushed your way to the front of the crowd and you vehemently tore down everything this talented person had so painstakingly affixed to the wall. Enboldened by your actions, everyone else followed your lead and began tearing all of this artwork to bits. When every last scrap of it was gone, you all seemed quite satisified with yourselves and most of the crowd scattered off to their respective locations. I looked at you, scrutinizing the bare wall, and I said, ""Hey! Do you know who made this one?""""Oh,"" you said. ""I did.""I walked over to an empty cafeteria table, put my knees up to my chest and I cried there for a long time.

657,5312201824,For the girl who wanted to hear a story - m4w,2015-11-12 10:01,/brk/mis/5312201824.html,brk,m4w,"","So I saw a girl on here the other day asking to hear a story, but her post was deleted before I could respond. So I guess I'm writing on the whim she'll see. Anyhow here goes. So when I was in highschool my mom was diagnosed with cancer. It sucked obviously, but my father had a good job so we as a family could deal with it fairly well. But after a couple year I suppose the stress got to him, he became depressed and lost his job, and with it all of our health benefits.(We didn't tell my mom because we thought it would only stress her out more). Anyhow cancer bills are expensive as fuck, and our family savings account started to run low after awhile, so my father came to me asking if I had any way to get money. He was on the verge of tears and I could tell it killed him to ask me for it but I told him I could try to find a way. I had been boxing since I was in middle school, and had been in amateur fights for a bit, so I asked my trainer if he could get me into anything that would pay me. I explained the situation to him and every month or so I would get in the ring with some asshole and afterwards get a couple bucks. I'd come home with a bloody ass face and give my dad a handful of cash so he could try to pay the bills, but after about a year like that I suppose my father felt guilty and told my mom what I had been doing to keep her alive. So when I came home one day they were on the couch and told me to come over. I sat down and my mother told me she loved me very much but she didn't want me wasting my money and time on her just as I was about to leave highschool and start college. I begged her not to but the next day she called her doctors and told them she no longer wanted treatment. She died several weeks later. My father was then committed to mental hospitals on and off while I went off to college until one day I came home for break to find him hanging from the rafters with a noose around his neck. Anyhow If somehow you see this (whomever asked for a story) then there you go. Sorry if I made you sad.",40.7127837,-74.0059413,2015-11-19 22:59:40.118083,2015-11-19 22:59:40.118083,Google Places API

Someone who is comfortable in their own skin, down-to-earth, hilarious, thoughtful, nostalgic, and is mostly an open book. Oh and vital: be young at heart.

As the water dripped you made a funny gesture like you were showering.I saw you in my art history class on the 354th floor of The NYU Universe.

Thats all I want to know.I saw you glance at me up and down in an elitist, uninterested manner on 12th and Broadway. So I assume you liked what you saw. I was in a light trenchcoat and black heels with a talking Louis Vuitton bag that was discussing politics to a vender on the street.I saw you at Central Park with your dog. You were reading a book to him on architecture and dead trees. Topics far too eccentric for even Liberaci's taste.Â I saw you on the C train toward Bubble Bath Island.

I have met a few women on CL, and they have even been very attractive and hot. Two were tourists. one was a divorced woman who had no interest in relationships and 3 others were just looking for a huge cock and/or some particular kink. I gave it to them.women like to get laid and to fuck. One of the ladies I was with said she was tired of getting to know a guy only to find out he was below average in bed too late. It makes sense to use CL and get what your looking for and not take a random chance on the guy at the bar being a good lay or whatever else you really want. This whole idea that you have to ""offer something more"" is the same mindset hookers have.. they want to cash in the pussy for a price. I have less respect for women who play that game than the type of woman who has sex for it's own sake. a woman who uses her vagina as some prize that extracts monetary or emotional good from a man is worse than a whore- at least a whore is honest and doesn't mislead you and play with your emotions. that type of women never really loves a man she is with, but merely sees him as a thing to be used. How low is that?I'm all for relationships, and I'd consider a relationship with a woman I met here more than I would some prissy judgemental game player who sees sex as a reward for good behavior or as a way to get goodies- emotional or otherwise.When you count dating sites, apps like tinder etc.. what we are seeing is women being more upfront about sex as an honest vehicle for their enjoyment, on their own terms, and that should be encouraged.

849,5326904184,just an opinion hookups or sex,2015-11-21 23:18,/lgi/mis/5326904184.html,lgi,sex,"","I wouldn't call them mutually inclusive. I think each individual decides the meaning of sex for themselves. Hookups pretty much says what has been decided. what I think of hookups would sound derogatory, its just not what I decided and if honest consenting adults agree, who's to say. then there are those who try to discover by experimenting. I personally think you are ""wiring"" yourself with experiences you may regret if you don't have the foresight to allow yourself that with an open mind, again, not for me. those who treat it as something too sacred may discover in a long term relationship or union, that ""sex"" will be many things, an expression and celebration of love, assurance and comfort, affirmation if you will during stormy times, then occasionally man or woman has an urge that needs to be satisfied and has the luxury of a willing partner they love, but that night it wont be about love and that's ok. so I think it's not about what sex is, but just declaring for yourself what it will be. I've had the misfortune to see women lose their ""compass"", when it is pleasurable to the point of obsession with just one aspect of life, do anything ,say anything, pretend it is anything for it to continue on. to see that the majority of energy, availability and focus was on sex. to tear herself and the other up over coming to terms with that, and when the other discovers such a thing doesn't want that, there is hell to pay. I respect anyone who is at least honest up front what it means to them and respects the others choice. leverage, just an urge to be satisfied, an act of love or a reward for being what somebody wanted you to be, if its up front, understood, let like minded people find each other. Both arguments I hear it is nothing to do with love, one is urges to be satisfied the other a prize for being a resource to you, to each their own. As for my experience with women, it was sad to see those who discovered too late that for some men it did represent what they had dreamed it should and given up on it..........till. sorry to disappoint but some do ""fuck"" with their heart, get it broken discovering it wasn't love but just the sex for her. What a man can do to a woman when he loves her and her the same, i'll say no thanks to everything else to protect that.",40.725400,-73.516600,2015-11-23 21:58:18.024819,2015-11-23 21:58:18.024819,detail page

She is on Craigslist 24-7 trying to get men to cheat on their significant others. She is quite repulsive looking and her personality resembles that of a wet mop. She pretends to be intelligent and tries to act like some comic loser guy's fantasy girl when in reality she is nothing she pretends to be. There are impressionable, vulnerable, inexperienced, dorky, pathetic men out there who will buy into this and their innate beer goggles will come on and their weak minds will actually entertain this. Please find out if your ""nerdyish"" or if you are dating or are married to a somewhat ""urban"" type guy who might be frequenting Craigslist singles behind your back if he is talking to her. She is ridiculous and ruthless. She will stand in front of your spouses building to catch a glimpse. She will follow you and/or him around because she thinks ""she got this"". These are the words she uses when she is trying to get your guy to do something bad. Please nip it in the bud when you catch wind of this.

As the water dripped you made a funny gesture like you were showering.I saw you in my art history class on the 354th floor of The NYU Universe. The professor began complaining about the students not handing their homework in on time and you interrupted with a stupendous fart. Did you eat falafel for breakfast? Thats all I want to know.I saw you glance at me up and down in an elitist, uninterested manner on 12th and Broadway. So I assume you liked what you saw. I was in a light trenchcoat and black heels with a talking Louis Vuitton bag that was discussing politics to a vender on the street.I saw you at Central Park with your dog. You were reading a book to him on architecture and dead trees. Topics far too eccentric for even Liberaci's taste.Â I saw you on the C train toward Bubble Bath Island. You looked like a cross between Yoko Ono and Alec Baldwin- certainly a strange combination but you seemed to pull it off. I am happily married but definitely down for Hot Pockets sometime if you have a microwave.I saw you running from the cops this evening at around 79th St and Watermelon Ave. You bumped into me and I spilled my diet Dr. Pepper all over my newborn baby. I shouted ""Hey Asshole, watch where you're going!"" You told me to go fuck myself and then you winked. Anyway if you want to see that new Steve Jobs movie with me sometime, shoot me an email. Tell me what kind of knife you were holding so I know its really you.I saw you at that rotten job I left months ago. I always wanted to say hi, but was too shy to approach you. Your talent was intimidating. But my coworker informed me that you didn't know what fracking was- maaaaaajor turn off dude.I saw you waking up in my bed and leaving quietly to return to your wife on the UWS. I'm pretty sure your underpants featured a Dr. Seuss character. Wish I had gotten your name.",40.740200,-73.999600,2015-11-23 22:12:16.379917,2015-11-23 22:12:16.379917,detail page

I have met a few women on CL, and they have even been very attractive and hot. Two were tourists. one was a divorced woman who had no interest in relationships and 3 others were just looking for a huge cock and/or some particular kink. I gave it to them.women like to get laid and to fuck. One of the ladies I was with said she was tired of getting to know a guy only to find out he was below average in bed too late. It makes sense to use CL and get what your looking for and not take a random chance on the guy at the bar being a good lay or whatever else you really want. This whole idea that you have to ""offer something more"" is the same mindset hookers have.. they want to cash in the pussy for a price. I have less respect for women who play that game than the type of woman who has sex for it's own sake. a woman who uses her vagina as some prize that extracts monetary or emotional good from a man is worse than a whore- at least a whore is honest and doesn't mislead you and play with your emotions. that type of women never really loves a man she is with, but merely sees him as a thing to be used. How low is that?I'm all for relationships, and I'd consider a relationship with a woman I met here more than I would some prissy judgemental game player who sees sex as a reward for good behavior or as a way to get goodies- emotional or otherwise.When you count dating sites, apps like tinder etc.. what we are seeing is women being more upfront about sex as an honest vehicle for their enjoyment, on their own terms, and that should be encouraged. Not the manipulative gameplaying we see from the original poster.","","",2015-11-23 22:13:01.166799,2015-11-23 22:13:01.166799,detail page

I think each individual decides the meaning of sex for themselves. Hookups pretty much says what has been decided. what I think of hookups would sound derogatory, its just not what I decided and if honest consenting adults agree, who's to say. then there are those who try to discover by experimenting. I personally think you are ""wiring"" yourself with experiences you may regret if you don't have the foresight to allow yourself that with an open mind, again, not for me. those who treat it as something too sacred may discover in a long term relationship or union, that ""sex"" will be many things, an expression and celebration of love, assurance and comfort, affirmation if you will during stormy times, then occasionally man or woman has an urge that needs to be satisfied and has the luxury of a willing partner they love, but that night it wont be about love and that's ok. so I think it's not about what sex is, but just declaring for yourself what it will be. I've had the misfortune to see women lose their ""compass"", when it is pleasurable to the point of obsession with just one aspect of life, do anything ,say anything, pretend it is anything for it to continue on. to see that the majority of energy, availability and focus was on sex. to tear herself and the other up over coming to terms with that, and when the other discovers such a thing doesn't want that, there is hell to pay. I respect anyone who is at least honest up front what it means to them and respects the others choice. leverage, just an urge to be satisfied, an act of love or a reward for being what somebody wanted you to be, if its up front, understood, let like minded people find each other. Both arguments I hear it is nothing to do with love, one is urges to be satisfied the other a prize for being a resource to you, to each their own. As for my experience with women, it was sad to see those who discovered too late that for some men it did represent what they had dreamed it should and given up on it..........till. sorry to disappoint but some do ""fuck"" with their heart, get it broken discovering it wasn't love but just the sex for her. What a man can do to a woman when he loves her and her the same, i'll say no thanks to everything else to protect that.",40.725400,-73.516600,2015-11-23 22:13:02.833041,2015-11-23 22:13:02.833041,detail page

But during both intervals (and afterwards) you were in lively conversation with an older man, and it didn't seem polite to interrupt, much as I was tempted to. . . So, on the off chance that you might look on this website: perhaps you remember me: I was in blue jeans, a short-sleeved blue shirt and was probably the only other person there under the age of 60. . .How'd you like the opera??","","",2015-11-23 22:13:17.034943,2015-11-23 22:13:17.034943,detail page

1082,5326471316,reply (1) to 'the thing about hookups' - w4m,2015-11-21 16:39,/brk/mis/5326471316.html,brk,w4m,"no, you have it mostly wrong","Her post was well-written but way off on some points. I can show exactly where the gaps are. She's basically suggesting we have no rational for what we do, but that is incorrect.1. First, the males here appear to be extremely superficial.True, but its much better to state that THIS CITY is the capital of superficiality. Both men and women are superficial here. To truly outlandish proportions. Sure, its obvious that men have an emphatic and definitive way of being superficial. But men and women are raised differently-- and have different biology, Women cheat as much as men do, but they do it discreetly. So who is really 'better' morally? No one.Consider this too: men's focus on sex is not really all THAT superficial because after all, sex is a core biological need and also one of the few ways humans can connect with each other. It may appear crass in today's day and age to pursue it so single-mindedly; but that's not really our fault. Men from *any era* are driven towards sex.2. but why on earth would a woman who has anythingto offer a guy give it away for nothing to some horny toad just because he asks?(For 'why give it away for nothing', see #5 below). As for 'why we ask': well, we come straight out and ask for sex because we don't need anything else from you. Remember: this society is a patriarchy, and men are the primary breadwinners. Every man has earning ability for himself. We don't need any monetary help from women. Thus, we don't let money affect our romantic choices at all. Can you babes say the same?Think about it. What else do we really need from you except sex? This is why we can afford to come right out and ask. We don't have any other need to 'bargain with you' for anything else.Any other type of conversation (romantic, or courting, or polite fencing) would--if a man were to engage in it--be akin to 'playing games'. That's your schtick, not ours.'Lengthy conversation' is a tool for a woman to 'size up' the man interested in her. She uses it to assess his viability to support her, to entertain her, she uses it to verify his social status. All of these 'extra concerns' come into play on YOUR side. Its just a bit ulterior and underhanded, wouldn't you say?3. ... if she is all that then wouldn't she already have one or more guys lined upto casually ""get busy"" if she was ""into"" that sort of thing?Yes. Which is why there are no really attractive, honest females on CList. Its all just scams and shills looking for 'support' and 'sugar daddies'. Whereas men at least have the directness to only come here asking for satisfaction of the simplest, most animal, most basic urge. We don't try to get anything else from females. We don't scam you for anything you shouldn't give up naturally. Not so, with females--they visit Clist not only seeking sex but seeking 'other gains'.So I ask you; who is more honest and above-board?4. Why would many guys here then seek to demean or flag a woman who wants more?It's her life to lead after all, not yours. Being sarcastic, offensive, rude, or flaggingwon't change her opinion. She doesn't care what you think, nor should she.You're correct. Flaggers are pathetic; they waste their time with pointless flagging. When a woman is on CList essentially 'playing the whore role' there is little chance of shaming her. She won't understand the basis for the shame. All she knows is she wants fiscal benefits as a 'perk' for her company. I guess it just irks us to see a whore 'thinking she's clever' or 'pretending-to-herself' that she isn't what she is.5. ...if a guy doesn't have anything to offer her then why should she take an interest?This is where you reveal a massive blind spot. The answer to your question rests right there in your question when you insist on ""being offered something"".Remember: sex is enjoyable by both men and women EQUALLY. Both sexes benefit from having sex--orgasms are the goal of both. So why then, should one side of the sexual union (women) seek or receive 'something extra'? Why should men have to 'offer' you anything?I put it to you. Why do women want some kind of 'extra recompense' ...for an activity which appeases both equally? You gloss right over this in all your theorizing.6. It's not like having sex or fooling around is considered a form of charity.Certainly not, since both parties receive pleasure from it. We men sure don't see sex as 'charity', but you women sure seem to see our wallets as a fund to console you for 'the loss' (of something) if you have sex with us. Why is that?This is not 'cheapness talking', either. We're willing to pay, but that *doesn't make it ethical* of you to expect it. After all, how would you react if we men began insisting you pay us (buy us dinner, auto-parts, power tools, etc) for the pleasure of our cocks? Well? No good, right? Right. You're in a seller's market. So enjoy it. It's the only market you can be in.See...your need for courtship is a darn shame. It certainly burdens you. But you can't take it out on us.7. ..we personally aren't into casual sex or casual fooling around. We think thatit's something meant for your boyfriend or husband. Otherwise how would it be special?We don't see how it could feel right if the guy wasn't our boyfriend or husband.Unfortunately, this is your (you and your friend's) individual emotional hangup. Its not how we men experience life, sex, or relationships. Nor, do many more mature women approach romance this way. Grown-ups just don't need sex to be 'special'. Your sentimentalism is just the emotional boondoggle of young girls. Its also why you have an affinity for children and child-rearing (children and girls inhabit the same emotional plane).Nevertheless, you just can't blame other types of adults for not being in this same boat with you. Viewing sex *unemotionally* is perfectly valid--whether or not you happen to believe so. If you had twenty more years of sexual experience, you would probably shake-your-heads-in-wonder at the emotionally-fragile, young-ingenue's plea you just expressed.8. ... if it's a matter of being horny, then okay, we don't consider ourselves to be prudes,but why wouldn't we just masturbate?Because you have emotional needs, economic needs, a need-for-status(marriage), and biological needs (childbirth). And well--you can't get any of those urges satisfied by masturbation. No woman wants to wind up a 'spinster' or an 'old-maid', do they?9. We of course know our body better than anyone else. If/when we do feel open to fool around on a rare occasion where there isn't a certain relationship, and instead of considering a guy we already know well as a friend, we would be open to consider a guy here, that is IF he is open, doesn't require sex, is perfectly fine with respecting whatever it is we find comfortable, and is willing to provide a contribution that would seem almost impossible to refuse, because it could practically be applied to things which would have us feel appreciated no differently than when we have long-term boyfriends or if we had husbands, then it all comes down to safety.This dense and confusing mishmash is basically a wishy-washy way of saying that sexually, you 'want to have your cake and eat it too'. In other words, you can't perceive casual sex as anything but a 'breaking of your goals' and therefore, it needs some kind of 'extra dividend' ...quite unfairly, paid for, by males.But again--since men aren't burdened by such emotionalism (we don't confuse sex with love) why should we pay for the guilt you feel when you 'obey your body' rather than 'follow your agenda'?10...if one was open to fool around and she has options, why would she consider a site thatguys imply is only about sex and for sex since this means that it's statistically more dangerousin terms of contracting a venereal disease?You're correct here (and in the rest of your arguments about STDs, as well).No argument from me on that score. CList is all about diseases. It doesn't mean though, that you can just walk away from sexual relationships. If you don't meet men via CList, you'd need to meet them some other way. The same predicament exists anywhere and everywhere you may turn. Its an age-old dilemma, but the bald truth is that women need to offer casual sex if they want to land a long-term romantic relationship. It sucks, but that is just how it is. So: play 'the game' carefully, and try to find a worthwhile guy out there who is a 'keeper'. But don't blame us for our biology. See, we get sexual urges every few seconds. As a woman, you need to 'take care of our needs' --if you want us to stay joined to you. This is not news. This is the way of the world, and always has been. Jane Austen can tell you so!You either measure up to it --the way women always have--or you remain stunted, babyish, little girls. There's no shortcut for you either, just because you live in the age of the cell-phone. (In fact, cell-phones AGGRAVATE the problem. Drop the cellphone lifestyle and you probably stand a better chance of making a good LTR with someone).11. The above only confirms why certain women aren't sleeping around. It's about value.Yes, we get sexually aroused like everyone else, but we exhibit self-control.The value for our lives and the respect we have for it and ourselves serve as remindersthat we are priceless.No. This is just 'conceit'. Vaginas very definitely DO have a price. Whores have vaginas, so do princesses, so do wealthy socialites, every woman has a vagina; and every woman has a price of some sort. The *winners* are women who use their vaginas for what they were intended (sex) without using them as a bargaining chip.Men will always get laid one way or another. So if you 'keep yourself off the market' because you are too delicate; too refined; too squeamish ...'too tender to mix in with the dirt of living'--then that is nothing more than being FOOLISH. 'Keep yourself on the shelf' ...and you simply lose out--on life.And it hurts everyone else, too. *Decreasingly* eligible women mean that men turn more piggish and more crass-- instead of improving into the gentlemen and princes you desire. If you reduce the number of sexually-accessible women you just make us more desperate, more impatient, and more foul. You hasten the 'race to the bottom'. Catch-22!You got questions...I have answers. Hope this helped.",40.688615,-73.989168,2015-11-23 22:13:21.550589,2015-11-23 22:13:21.550589,detail page

First, the males here appear to be extremely superficial. Not that there'sanything wrong with that, but why on earth would a woman who has anythingto offer a guy give it away for nothing to some horny toad just because he asks?Second, if she is all that then wouldn't she already have one or more guys lined upto casually ""get busy"" if she was ""into"" that sort of thing?Why would many guys here then seek to demean or flag a woman who wants more?It's her life to lead after all, not yours. Being sarcastic, offensive, rude, or flagging won't change her opinion. She doesn't care what you think, nor should she. Third, if a guy doesn't have anything to offer her then why should she take an interest?It's not like having sex or fooling around is considered a form of charity.Fourth, we personally aren't into casual sex or casual fooling around. We think thatit's something meant for your boyfriend or husband. Otherwise how would it be special?We don't see how it could feel right if the guy wasn't our boyfriend or husband.Fifth, if it's a matter of being horny, then okay, we don't consider ourselves to be prudes,but why wouldn't we just masturbate? We of course know our body better than anyone else.Six, if/when we do feel open to fool around on a rare occasion where there isn't a certain relationship, and instead of considering a guy we already know well as a friend, we would be open to consider a guy here, that is IF he is open, doesn't require sex, is perfectly finewith respecting whatever it is we find comfortable, and is willing to provide a contribution that would seem almost impossible to refuse, because it could practically be applied to thingswhich would have us feel appreciated no differently than when we have long-term boyfriends or if we had husbands, then it all comes down to safety.Seven, if one was open to fool around and she has options, why would she consider a site thatguys imply is only about sex and for sex since this means that it's statistically more dangerousin terms of contracting a venereal disease?Eight, we all know that the likelihood of people using Saran Wrap, dental dams or condoms (latex) is extremely rare in general and especially at a site like this where males seem to be so focused on sex and freely expressing their need for sex, so why would someone want to hookupwith a guy who has no value for his life and would play Russian roulette with it?Nine, if someone is willing to provide test results to prove that he's disease free, this is no proof of his activities since he's last been tested.Ten, if a man is willing to provide new test results taken right before you consider fooling around, then what proof is there of abstinence thereafter should you choose to engage such activities again?How many people even if they have been testedin the not too distant past with documentation to prove it, are actually getting tested again immediately before the possibility of sexual activity? Very few.To summarize, our disinterest in hookups doesn't mean that we are lesbian, dislike men or are fat and ugly. In fact, it's the opposite. The above only confirms why certain women aren't sleeping around. It's about value. Yes, we get sexually aroused like everyone else, but we exhibit self-control. The value for our lives and the respect we have for it and ourselves serve as remindersthat we are priceless.AMEN.","","",2015-11-23 22:14:40.027706,2015-11-23 22:14:40.027706,detail page

1182,5324406886,Re: I guess this is it - Reply. - m4w,2015-11-20 11:26,/brk/mis/5324406886.html,brk,m4w,Brooklyn,"✨❤️✨❤️✨❤️- Congratulations on your engagement! - ✨❤️✨❤️✨❤️✨To avoid confusion - Non of the other Craigslist ads currently up are mine. I only reply to Craigslist ad email like I did a few days to you :) - mainly to avoid imposters leading you or me on. I wanted to hold out on sending you a reply because I meant it when I said I would give you the time and space you need, but alas the latest Ad of yours is up and I would like you to hear me out before you do anything drastic. I wrote the following except last week, please don't do anything drastic!Response to Craigslist Ad: I'm not over you, I'm over it.I'm still at a shelter and I have guy sleeping 4 feet away who got out of prison for murde. . ... 2 people (only served 15 years) he's clearly unstable and has anger issues and he takes it out on me, its scary, he could snap at any moment, the building is filled with cases like this, its very stressful, the firth time I got out at Union Square I was in shock, sane people everywhere our age happily walking around, some with boyfriends and girlfriends, I couldn't really handle it, I left shortly after. It made me realise how much I missed the most basic and simple things that most people take for granted. I can't remember the last time I had a normal meal, or normal and engaging conversation with sane people or what its like to live without a curfew. I know what I need to work on getting, real food, job, money, friends, GF, just to look down at a smiling face.I want you to know that if you are in a relationship and things are going really well and I don't want to do anything to disrupt that, nor do I want to bring my incredibly despairing situation upon you, I don't expect you or anyone else to save me, nor would it be fair for you to deal with my dramatic fall. I can't stand to seeing you hurting.To answer your question; I would be very happy to remain friends, nothing wrong with that! I've already met other females, going so far as to spend the last of my cash on cocktails and tips, the connection just wasn't there. But if you just want to be friends, like we originally planed, I'll keep searching for someone who makes me as happy as I was with you and keep the friendship between us.Would be nice to hear from you again, I'd love to hear how you're doing, how are you? are you seeing someone? are you happy? what are you up to theses days? did you have a nice summer? It would be really nice to see you and your little buddy again :)Response to Craigslist Ad: I guess this is it Yes I am very lonely, anyone in my situation would be very lonely going through everything on their own it is very painful. But you must understand that I never reached out just to get your attention, my feelings for you are very real and they don't have anything to do with filling the void or finding purpose in life, I really think you're special, I don't care what anyone else says about you, I know you're really great person, I mean I was aroused by thoughts of you half an hour ago, does that make me crazy?I know we're not getting younger. I know I have to consider marriage to a sexy, unique and kickass partner in crime sometime soon who's willing to to go on a wild ride with me, put up with my intense passion, maybe have some kids too. I don't want to die alone thats for sure. Since the breakup I wanted to be their for you the entire time, It was very very hard seeing you hurt, it tears me up. I wasn't just trying to get back with you I was also trying to communicate, to clear up the confusion and help you. I've always wanted you to be happy and I really believe that that we can find peace, you don't need to do anything drastic like erase me form you life. I don't want you to be miserable till spring. I have done research about your condition and relize now that I should have done some things differently.The ambition to do something great is still there, I just haven't seen the light. might not see it for a long time, I want to get back on my feet and have a real career, be successful and a have roof over my head. Thats what I'm focused on now. Thats on me.I promise my love won't interfere with friendshsip,we could remain friends, even if we never fuck, do what best friends do or go to places we dream of. I'd love to help where I can with your wedding, I'm a resourceful guy. . .. . .. . ..if you preferred putting friendship on hold, until I found someone else, that would be fine with me.Please meet me half way, if after the first day you don't think it'll work, I'll honour whatever very you wish to become of it, no protestations or drama. No one understands me like you do, thats rare and I don't want to loose that, so please be brave and believe its possible. I miss waking up to that beautiful tangle of hair in the morning and cooking breakfast, walking down the sidewalk together or your sweet lips, phew amazing. I miss the simplest things about you.If I had a choice, If I could do it all over again I'd make sure I don't hurt you. I'm just so passionate for you, I don't want that to die, I love and miss you.On the craigslist Ad you said I should just contact you directly, I was actually thinking it be best if you contacted me first via my gmail email, text message or FaceTime. . .. the latter two options might not work since my I don't have mobile credit.","","",2015-11-23 22:15:24.316719,2015-11-23 22:15:24.316719,detail page

My farewell set me free from her for good. when I told I could not feel ""awful"" for her because she has no empathy for others whatsoever? her response, to through everybody, anybody under the bus to open the door again. innocent ppl of no consequences to her and I. So if your theory about karma is true.......what makes you think she isn't suffering it now. to me that would be a waste of ""karma"". a selfish, deceiving soul will NEVER, NEVER, NEVER change. that is the lesson I learned. so support your friend, your right, but don't be so sure you really know her or anything about ""karma"". i'll take the moral authority every man should. peace of mind, I was there for her when I knew she would not be the same for me; I was to her what she would never be to me; I was what she wanted. someone just for her, not to use as a resource, take from her, run her to death, outgrow her and leave her abandoned and alone, unless I need something else. no whats understood is she will never be ""someone just for me"" . so I don't know a polite way to say fuck you and your stupidity in not seeing why she is sooo devasted. but it's your turn , you will discover. if your response is not mistaken. if i'm garbage and was more than she ever could be to me, there when I had a right to say no more, you worry about what that must make her. she only took and demanded, her vacation is over.",40.725400,-73.516600,2015-11-23 22:16:05.263876,2015-11-23 22:16:05.263876,detail page

I am about 5'11"" tall, average build and work in a law firm in Manhattan.I know people have told me not to put too much detail into this post, but I want to begin by being HONEST about my circumstances, what I am looking for, and HOPEFULLY someone out there will have either been in a similar situation, or at least be able to empathize to the point of (I hope) a cup of coffee, at least.First of all about AGE? Doesnt matter.. all my life was in relationships with my age.. yet last gf was 21 and I am late 50s. We were together as a couple for 3 years. She was tired of guys her age who only wanted her for the physical, then left her. She wanted someone more Mature who would truly take time to get to know her as a person. Someone Older who would listen to her thoughts, feelings, respect, care for her.And romantically, someone more Mature who would take time for warmth, affection, Tenderness. Someone who would go slow---hold hands, cuddle, be gentle.That is why it worked.. and why it PROVES when it comes to age it is truly just a number. For feelings are Universal at any age.So if you are in my age range, fine. But if younger, doesnt matter!Either way!OK so that being said, here goes (LOL):Some time ago I lost many things at once:1) Girlfriend of 7 years (she broke up);2) Best male friends of 20 years (they did not die but went their own way)3) My car4) My job (D0NT WORRY I have a good job now)5) And my own place (share for now --divorced for 10 years now, can prove it and saving to get OWN place again in 4 months).Subsequent to all those losses, I did make 1 true friend (platonic) and was in a relationship with a woman for 1-1/2 years, which ended a few months ago (she moved out of NY).At this point, I am seeking a friend to talk to, to do things with.I AM SO TIRED of doing everything ALONE.. it HURTS!Id like to meet a pleasant, warm female companion to share things with.. movies, walks, anything we have in common.I enjoy bowling, outdoors, LOVE nature.. fresh air, trees, and music.Love All kinds of music pretty much.. books, moviesBut most especially just being with a special person.It is NOT easy to be ALONE in NY. And despite the fact I have recovered pretty much from what I pointed out in the 5 points above, being alone again now. Just feels empty.. especially around the holidays!I put this ad in BOTH the platonic section AND the dating section because I am OPEN to both friendship AND romance.I happen to be a very Affectionate person, love to hug, cuddle? I love it.Ultimately, I am looking for a woman I can CHERISH, treasure for her mind, heart and soul? a woman who wants a man who will be LOYAL, TRUSTING, who will stand by her no matter what.. who will be her best friend, her soulmate.A man who she can turn to at all times.. to lean on for strength, emotional support. Who will be tender, gentle, and loving.If ure looking for that too.. not a man who plays games but a man who can be DEVOTED, WARM, loving, a good listener.. empathic.. im here!I am college educated, and fix computers on the side.. so if u need any help with your computer, feel free to ask.OK that's about it. IF you are looking for an older man or a man your age that you can talk to, lean on, who will listen to your feelings or just have fun with, please write me.All I ask is that if you are interested, to meet for coffee and talk.. that?s all I ask. IN PUBLIC of course so u feel SAFE.. and play it all by ear from there.I am trying very much to get my own place in COUPLE of months.. still paying for co op where I live with ex wife.. have own room she dates I date. its just financial.But I want to sell the coop soon this year.. its probably worth almost $250,000.. even when I split proceeds with ex wife (which I have to do by law- can still probably come out of it with more than $60,000 maybe even more.But to do that there are certain emotional issues involved, and to be honest having a friend.. or hopefully that special person.. that special warm soulmate to help me deal with these issues would be a gift from God himself.I hope there is someone OUT there who can understand how it is to be in this situation, and needs a friend (at least!) to TALK TO.

Idc if it's a fantasy or what ever the situation is. My heart has so much love. And this love belongs to you. Claim your prize lol. Happy thanksgiving I do wish the absolute best for you and your loved ones. And ummm I so desperately want to be one of those loved ones. Anyway Michele you are so beautiful imagine how beautiful you are to me as love= Michele. I would need so much help if you don't love me. Without you telling me the truth my life will be one big question with every thought hurtful as I was deeply in love with you and your smile and your cute nose. I know your smart strong willed stubborn as hell. Specially to me. But you know my life revolves around you. You my friend had my life on pause since 97. I had no thoughts of my future cause you were my stepping stone for my future. Maybe your right I am obsessed and dillisional and displayed stalking behavior but I need to see talk. To you as you are such a big part of it. How do I tell myself Michele wants nothing and will want nothing to ever do with you. When thoughts cross your mind there's no smile? There's no love felt from your heart to me. Missed loved is what you are. Let's just have the loved there. May your first bite of thanksgiving dinner bring a smile to your face from a happy imagine/ thought of terry. Thinking of you. It's impossible not to. You take 95% of my energy. And yes I have no plan. I need you to say hi then we could plan such a life. Maybe I'm a fool to feel it's knot over with the two of us as I hold on to that hope and faith that love does not fade when it's true love and that my loved one has my heart not willing to let go. Maybe being a cancer fucked me on this one as I can't let go of you. You mean to much to terry. He wants to kiss you. Brief words in between but kissing you is something I want so bad in this lifetime. K. No more Rampling or confessing how much I love you. Or how much I hurt. Just want you to know this heart has love for you. Has held wants to share. I love you. Well my heart loves you. I upset at you lol.

But we didn't interact. I've made promises to myself to act next time I do feel any sort of energy towards anyone, and acknowledge that a connection exists. I thought through scenarios in my head...would I ask you to try a smoothie, I wondered what your voice sounded like. As you were near my table I was with a customer, fumbling over my words, feeling your presence around me. My body became nervous, and before I knew it you left. I watched you check out and exit. I thought I saw you glance back at me as you left. I wonder, was that connection two-sided?

I believed then and still believe now that you are the one for me. Though the situation I am in now would make it difficult, I would do it for you. Does it make me selfish?

I was done, not interested in stories, lies or manipulation. just bored to death with such a shallow person, no depth of soul, maybe no soul. you will get through this, the sooner you let go of such things, it WILL feel like everything is going your way compared to what you endure now. the irony, away from me, her life seemed to be disintegrating under her feet. call it karma, anger the gods, whatever, but it spooked me even more . it seemed as all the lies and harm she has done to others was claiming her. it felt like she angered something for forsaking a second chance just to be a better person no strings attached. I say leave it behind you, take off the rear view mirror and hit the gas. i'm glad I did, I don't give a shit about words that come out of a liars mouth, she never loved me, all she has done? she never loved anybody including herself. you cant give love if you don't have it. she would never tell another soul what she told me, that perhaps she doesn't know how to love anybody, probably the only truth she ever said. so all that said, does it sound like the love story she describes? hardly worth hearing. stop writing such a story with your life and write the one you deserve as I decided to do.",40.743615,-73.532696,2015-11-25 23:22:18.146125,2015-11-25 23:22:18.146125,detail page

1864,5326936475,The thing about hookups- response to both posters - w4m,2015-11-22 00:30,/mnh/mis/5326936475.html,mnh,w4m,"","I have no idea what you are both going on bout, because women do like sex, one night stands and getting laid. I have met a few women on CL, and they have even been very attractive and hot. Two were tourists. one was a divorced woman who had no interest in relationships and 3 others were just looking for a huge cock and/or some particular kink. I gave it to them.women like to get laid and to fuck. One of the ladies I was with said she was tired of getting to know a guy only to find out he was below average in bed too late. It makes sense to use CL and get what your looking for and not take a random chance on the guy at the bar being a good lay or whatever else you really want. This whole idea that you have to ""offer something more"" is the same mindset hookers have.. they want to cash in the pussy for a price. I have less respect for women who play that game than the type of woman who has sex for it's own sake. a woman who uses her vagina as some prize that extracts monetary or emotional good from a man is worse than a whore- at least a whore is honest and doesn't mislead you and play with your emotions. that type of women never really loves a man she is with, but merely sees him as a thing to be used. How low is that?I'm all for relationships, and I'd consider a relationship with a woman I met here more than I would some prissy judgemental game player who sees sex as a reward for good behavior or as a way to get goodies- emotional or otherwise.When you count dating sites, apps like tinder etc.. what we are seeing is women being more upfront about sex as an honest vehicle for their enjoyment, on their own terms, and that should be encouraged.

1867,5326904184,just an opinion hookups or sex,2015-11-21 23:18,/lgi/mis/5326904184.html,lgi,sex,"","I wouldn't call them mutually inclusive. I think each individual decides the meaning of sex for themselves. Hookups pretty much says what has been decided. what I think of hookups would sound derogatory, its just not what I decided and if honest consenting adults agree, who's to say. then there are those who try to discover by experimenting. I personally think you are ""wiring"" yourself with experiences you may regret if you don't have the foresight to allow yourself that with an open mind, again, not for me. those who treat it as something too sacred may discover in a long term relationship or union, that ""sex"" will be many things, an expression and celebration of love, assurance and comfort, affirmation if you will during stormy times, then occasionally man or woman has an urge that needs to be satisfied and has the luxury of a willing partner they love, but that night it wont be about love and that's ok. so I think it's not about what sex is, but just declaring for yourself what it will be. I've had the misfortune to see women lose their ""compass"", when it is pleasurable to the point of obsession with just one aspect of life, do anything ,say anything, pretend it is anything for it to continue on. to see that the majority of energy, availability and focus was on sex. to tear herself and the other up over coming to terms with that, and when the other discovers such a thing doesn't want that, there is hell to pay. I respect anyone who is at least honest up front what it means to them and respects the others choice. leverage, just an urge to be satisfied, an act of love or a reward for being what somebody wanted you to be, if its up front, understood, let like minded people find each other. Both arguments I hear it is nothing to do with love, one is urges to be satisfied the other a prize for being a resource to you, to each their own. As for my experience with women, it was sad to see those who discovered too late that for some men it did represent what they had dreamed it should and given up on it..........till. sorry to disappoint but some do ""fuck"" with their heart, get it broken discovering it wasn't love but just the sex for her. What a man can do to a woman when he loves her and her the same, i'll say no thanks to everything else to protect that.",40.725400,-73.516600,2015-11-25 23:25:32.453928,2015-11-25 23:25:32.453928,detail page

Even in the very formation of their claims.Seriously, if you're going to go off on a diatribe like you just did--choose 'safer ground' from which to preach. Rely on more solid examples to support your assertions.Most of your post is a rant against stalkers and harassment. Okay, fine. But you don't know enough about internet law to go around trying to scare people with threats of lawsuit. That's #1.#2, if you're going to take such an intellectual, lordly posture and waggle-your-finger down at the rest of us, you'd better know how to write intelligently. Halfway through your post you descend into pure gibberish. It was overly-wordy to the point of unintelligibility. Learn how to state your points succinctly if you want impact. Less is more. You kept reiterating your gripes--various ways of stating the same premise--and you quickly lost all the force you were hoping for.Finally, this theory of yours (below) is entirely thin. An 'audience' can certainly identify traits in a performer ...regardless of the performance the actor *believe* they provided.  The actor is the least trustworthy authority on what they conveyed with their performance. Audience input is the final --and sole--arbitrator of whether the actor was convincing or not.You can certainly follow the career of an actor and make all sorts of observations about their personality regardless of the roles they take up or the masks they don. It is merely ""actor's conceit"" to believe they are totally submerged in a role by the power or skill in their portrayal. Wrong: The fact that you think you can genuinely ""know"" a woman based upon the roles in entertainment she chooses to consider, e.g. she played a werewolf so she must be a werewolf, she played a bitch, so she must be a bitch, is just plain stupid and downright ignorant of you.It's a darn shame you don't want things hurled in your face, but this weak rationale of yours is not the way to undercut such public castigation.",40.649912,-73.949806,2015-11-30 04:34:52.998363,2015-11-30 04:34:52.998363,Google Places API

In entertainment, when someone takes on the role of a script, it doesn't mean in any way that the actress taking on the role or script is the same person in real life or that you as a complete stranger have the right to know what she is like in real life. That's called her private life. If you're a stranger, you have no right to invade her private life. If you feel entitled to push and provoke in attempts to know her private life, it's called invasion of privacy, a crime punishable by law. Your obsessive actions also suggest coercion and duress.The fact that you think you can genuinely ""know"" a woman based upon the roles in entertainment she chooses to consider, e.g. she played a werewolf so she must be a werewolf, she played a bitch, so she must be a bitch, is just plain stupid and downright ignorant of you.If anyone seems ""shrewish"" to use your choice of word, I'd suggest that you first look at your actions. I doubt that if your disposition and actions have been kind, warm, giving, accepting, generous and understanding, you would have received a ""shrewish"", bad-tempered personality in return.If you've perceived a kind person as bad-tempered, perhaps it's because you have prejudged that person based upon preconceived notions to reflect qualities which are of your life and self, e.g. mean, vicious, cruel, invasive, and then projected such qualities onto her. Perhaps you resent or envy your differences. The bigger and more signficant questions are if you have perceived a woman as ""bad-tempered""why would you contact her again and again as if you're obsessed with her IF you're such a saint?Why would you obsessively be contacting someone with whom you are simply incompatible?Is that not harassment and abuse? Then, how could you expect to be logically received in a warm and open, welcoming manner?Furthermore, the overwhelming implication that guys at this site resent the subject of money as if it's not a basic reality and necessity of life from the moment you wake in the morning to the moment you end your day, a means to freedom and power, and a way to markedly improve your own life and the lives of others, suggests that their mentality, lifestyle and upbringing is something foreign to me, almost like a different language. Everyone in my world is all about the freedom that money provides - making it, investing it, spending it, donating it, spoiling others with it. To have enough money means the good life, to have enough to retire, to have enough to enjoy, to have enough to obtain what you need when you need it, to take things to the next level or improve your situation if it's not what it needs to be, to be able to care for others when they are in need. If you're not this type of guy and I make clear that this is the type of guy I seek, I'm doing you a favor. I'm letting you know off the bat that we're incompatible. Most people and relationship counselors consider differences in how you view money as relevant to basic compatibility. This doesn't mean that we can't perfectly coexist at the site along with our differences. In addition, the choices a woman makes are her business, not yours. All that should matter to you is if by the content of the ad and followup you seem compatible or not. If by the content of the ad you seem clearly incompatible or looking for different things, there's NO legitimate reason to make contact. This is clearly indicated under Prohibited of Terms of Use AND the option to check do not contact me with unsolicited offers. A role, product, or service has more or less value based upon what someone is willing to pay. That which is of the highest value is generally appealing to someone who can appreciate and afford it. Just because you don't see the value or are unable to afford it, doesn't mean everyone lacks the ability or interest.It's the general mentality of certain members of this site in regard to ads placed here that if ""you're not like us"", i.e. discrimination, and we dislike what you represent or how we perceive you, we will abuse you until you have no choice, but to leave, i.e. harassment, both of which are illegal in the eyes of the law. To name call and use incorrect terminology in attempts to demean and disparage a woman, i.e. verbalabuse, although the terms(s) as defined in the English language in the dictionary do(es) not apply, i.e. defamation and libel, makes you seem abusive, immature and dumb, it doesn't make the inapprpriate language apply. The offenders use abusive, vulgar terminology in regard to strictly platonic ads and content which is expressly written as nonsexual, and simply does not apply.I suggest that you be honest with yourself. If you have that much time on your hands to follow around the ads of and reply to someone whom you've implied is blatantly incompatible and bad-tempered, then what is missing from :::your life:::? Why are you not focused on :::your life:::?To be clear, I would have zero reason to pen this post if it wasn't for online stalkers and trolls making contact via cl relay email. I don't have the need to email people with whom I'm uncompatible. I'm focused on my best life. How about you?

I came to your office back in 2007 or so because I was having a dispute with my roommate. You were a free Pro Se attorney there and gave me advice on how to deal with her (in the Resource Room/Help Center, room 404 I believe). I remember you being kind of angry and bossy and impatient, not at me, just in general, like the job was driving you crazy. I could understand, given the circumstances and the ghetto, thuggish crowd you mostly deal with there (on that particular day I saw you, a black man with dreads in the elevator threatened to ""shoot up the place"" because he didn't want to wait on line anymore and you called Security on him... another time I went a 20 something female accused some 70 year old woman of ""flirting with her man"" just because the older lady said excuse me as they formed a queue/line, and the young woman then threatened to beat her up. Ridiculous stuff like that.. You were one of the most intense people I've ever met...You were impeccably dressed in a navy blue suit, a fit white male with dark, dark brown hair and beautiful cheekbones to match intensely blue eyes. There's nothing sexier than a man bossin' a woman around. I need a man like that- one who is 'in charge' and in touch with his masculinity. Naturally dominant, no props needed... Let me stroke that hair and those cheekbones and melt you down... I'm a swf (white), 5 ft 7, 35 years old, with long auburn colored hair, curvy where it counts (back and front), very busty, green eyes.

Considering you're the audience to be reading this, I first wanted to acknowledge and greet you.

Are you interested in me? If so, is it full-time? Part-time? Freelance? You do know that those with full-time status receive benefits, right? Part-timers get to attend uninspired meetings in a cheap effort to make them feel like they're included, and the ones who freelance, well, they're just taken advantage of and shit upon.

There are many factors involved in this confusion. Here are a few, listed in no particular order:1) At this point in my life, I'm done with baseless alliances. I want something of substance, whether it be a friendship or more. I'm not sure you're at this same stage.2) There are other people involved - friends and family near and dear to us. Furthering things and subsequently fucking them up fucks those people up, too, probably creating one of those fucking rifts in which people feel as if they must pick fucking sides. That's a lot of fucking pressure not to fuck up.3) I like downers and you like uppers.I'm aware these are all issues that are easily solved by real, face to face communication.

In the being you would sneak me into your place. I would get ready in your bathroom then have you take me into you room. I remember the first time. You FUCK me so hard, I was in love from that moment on. Our best moment ever, and at the top of my list, was the time it was very late, and you wanted me to come over, but your folks was home. I parked across the street from your place, and you had me come in through the back door which lead to your unfinished basement. I remember how dark, dusty and cold it was. We made out on the old leather sofa. Then you got rock hard and made me to blow you. I took a hit of poppers the moment stood up and throw a towel on the floor. You fucked me so hard that I couldn't keep still. You pushed you palm into my mouth to try to quiet me. We broke all our condoms that night, a common theme in our sex affair. I was covered in your sweat and dust. I still get hot thinking about it. The sweetest part, hours later when we were done we split a can of Spite. We hung out a few times after, but then lost contact. I really hope this letter finds you. Sexual we're a match. You were the first person to 1.) Love my look and 2.) Keep up with me in my sex life.

I would never respect how you neglect and treat others. yes I turned every invitation away, to absorb what I knew you would do on this day for someone else. and my instincts were right. next year I will provide thanksgiving for someone who has none, to honor what you are not. so it is, life tangled with you, both of us did nothing. i'm sorry I couldn't find the heart for others this year, your darkness just preyed on my mind knowing exactly what you would be doing and your false best wishes concealing contempt, enjoy your day, I knew what you meant by that before you ever told me. everybody should be miserable just because you are?

I lived on Martha's Vineyard. The connection was strong and it lasted a good 3 weeks. not long, but for the gays of nowadays, perhaps, Maybe!It's taken me sometime to get to a point in life, by dating others and not dating for lengthy periods at all to say, that I think I'm finally getting up in the morning and not thinking of you daily. Everything truly does happen for a reason, sounds kitsch or cliche, but it works. The biggest lesson I've learned in my first few years of my 30's is to always just Trust your gut instincts. A foot in and a foot out, doesn't lead to a relationship, it only leads to doubt. DO I regret leaving? well, Yes! obviously. Not only did I disappoint you but I let myself down. I never gave myself the chance to see where things may have led. In retrospect would I have wanted to stay and keep those last 18 hours? Yes. absolutely. I think it would've solidified a lot more for you to be honest. It's my belief that even though you fight things in your heart and mind, and you can tell yourself NO I'm not ready a million times over....you really don't have a choice. Good, and bad things come when you least expect them. Do I wish things between us were different? not entirely, because I don't think in the grander scheme of things I made a mistake. I do just wish we stayed friends. It's really hard to find someone you can talk to about almost anything and let alone who has a Gilmore Girl DVD collection.

Here's some shared wisdom.If it's not for you, please don't prevent those who are able to be inspired to benefit from it. Thank you. To the person who contacted me to say she? finds it contradictory,it's because life is contradictory. There's no one-size-fits-all, not one reactionor one set of circumstances. There's only general wisdom you gain from life and experience.Just because you claim to not find the wisdom useful based upon your own miserable, angry self,doesn't mean others won't find the info enlightening and uplifting given their own experiences.We do not all lead the same life or see it through the same set of eyes. This should be obvious.Furthermore, circumstances in regard to gen'l online intertaction at this site do not applyto people in general in their own circle of life. Just because you relate to being abused and find it perfectly sound and natural, doesn't make it the case for everyone else. Some people have more respect for themselves and others and believe they are worthy of betterwhether they come from a hard life or not. Just because you're hardened and guarded and see that as ""normal"" doesn't make it the reality for everyone else. Some people see purity and kindness as freedom and anger and pain as a prison of your own making. That's a fact, not a judgment. The point of general wisdom is that you apply it where it suits you, where it provides you peaceand understanding, not to suggest that a wisdom applies to each and every situation in life. If you've interpreted the list to say that it applies to each and every situation and each and every person, then it looks like you're the one who needs an education. More importantly, you really shouldn't be so angry, especially on a holiday which is about gratitude. It's a sin. Yes, that's my opinion. It's my post! 1) Make peace with your pastso it won't screw up the present.2) Time healsalmost everything.Give it time.Or make peacewith yourselfto let it go.You're doing it for yourselfnot for the one's who hurt you.3) Don't compareyour life to othersand don't judge others.You have no ideawhat their journey is about.There are so many anonymous CL-ershere who are so quick to judge ratherthan accept that we are just different.If they allowed others to be, otherswouldn't have the need to return a taste of their own medicine. What do not judge is sayingis live and let live.If you are not judging in the first place,you won't receive it back.A person can be focused on her own lifeand there are strangers who seek to givetheir two cents and butt into it where itwas never requested. That's what promptsan article such as this one. 4) You can't go through lifebelieving that everyonewill understand you,relate to you,or even accept you.You can only voice your opinion.The difference between placing an ad and responding to an email is that placing an ad says you decide whether you wish to open it and read it,but if it's not for you, no problem skip it.Find something which works for you.An email suggests that you're on the same pageor why would you be bothering to email in the first place?So then when someone opens an email and it was unsolicitedand doesn't respect the request of what was asked, then it's judgment.it's alos in violation of TOU.What you say,how you feel,what you believe,what you haveDo not allowjudgment from othersto stop you from being you(if what you are doing is notcausing harm to anyone). 5) What others think of youis none of your business(so there is no point to email strangers when their ad does not resonate with you).6) Never stop believing in hope.Miracles happen everyday.7) The less you respond to negative people,the more peaceful your life will become.(When you speak out it's an ablution for yourselfand those who understand you). 8) A negative mindwill never give you a positive life.(People email others here even if they have nothing nice to saywhen it makes no rational sense to anyone).9) Perpetual optimismis a force multiplier.(Try kindness).10) If you keep focusing on what you fear,that's exactly where you'll end up.Learn to separate the facts from the pain.Be aware of the difference.11) Remember, it's not the conditions,but the decisions which determine our lives.Trust actions; words may deceive you.13) Silence is the best reply to a fool.14) The way of the miracle worker isto see all human behavioras one of two things,loveor a callto love.People who are in pain deliver pain.You can't fix other's problemsif it harms you in the process.Deception drains life energy.Toxicity poisons the soul.Accept situations whichare transparent and simple.If you ask direct questions,and don't receive direct answers,accept that the person is troubledand you will be a vessel for that painfor as long as you choose to stick around.15) One smile can start a friendship.One word can end a fight.One look can save a relationship.One person can change your life.It all depends on who is on the receiving end.Some people demand more of youthan you're able to giveor can afford to lose.By the time they come around,if they ever do,you no longer want what you had acceptedwhen it was first offered.Not everyone sees giving as receiving.You'll definitely feel it when someonehas trouble being pure in his giving.Your interaction will be riddled with confusionbecause the interaction is less than honest.Don't force it. Accept that what you see is the truthand release it rather than apply your energy hopingthat it's something positive.If you're receiving pain and confusion, believe it.If you're receiving kindness, warmth and generosity, believe it.Not everyone will be on your vibrational level.If you stick around negative energy long enoughit will adversely affect your own.Good people tend to be trusting because they are trustworthy.Online this can be a disaster if you run into one of many online fakeswho says one thing, but does another. He will create an image in orderto bait or interest you, but you will quickly learn that he doesn't keep his word.That's how you instantly know they're fake. Another way is that they'll attemptto place you on the defensive for their own bad behavior. I have a friend whodid his thesis on the subject of what is real and the fake profiles which exist online.That's just how prevalent it is. Beware.16) The way of the Universeand *its goodness*stills you,enlightens you,energizes you,andcalms you.Purity and goodnessdo notdeceive,condemn,confuseor use defense mechanismsto then blame youfor the energy they brought to the table.You may just be there in stillness taking it all in.Feeling drained and confused should be an instant warning.Honest communications and actions are not difficult to understand.Manpulative and malicious actions will confuse you if that's not of you.17) When someoneshows you who he is,believe him the first time.Do not grant repeated chancesto someone who has already failed you.It's far easier to work on yourselfthan to change another who hasn't asked.18) I heard earlier today that we speakand envision ""men"", but many people actmore like animals devoid of any self-controlor filter or care in regard to others,or deference to any religious figure or poweror spirit greater than themselves.There's no shame, guilt or fear.If you see the world as one way,and another operates on or was raised with opposite principles,it will be a challenge to understand or relate to one another.19) Should you ever find yourselfthe victim of another'sbitterness,smallnessor insecurities,things could be worse;YOU could be them.20) You can't reach for anything newif your hands and heartare laden with yesterday's junk.Let it go.21) The best thing about your past is thatit shows you what not to bring into the future.The people with whomyou choose to surround yourselfinfluence youwhether you like it or not.Choose wisely.22) Great minds discuss ideas;average minds discuss events;small minds discuss people.23) Let therefinement andimprovementof your own life,keep you fulfilledso that you haveno time to criticize others.24) If you expect the worldto be fair to youbecause you are fair,then you're fooling yourself.It's like expectingthe lion not to eat you,because you did not eat them.Conversely, it is ethical people who follow ethical principles,such as ""Do unto others as you'd have done unto you.""25) It's not what you look at that matters,it's what you choose to see.If it doesn't work for you,walk away.Your soul will never win if you allowa poisoned mind to damage your heart.26) If people live with criticism,they learn to condemn.If they live with hostility,they learn to fight.If they live with fear,they learn to be apprehensive.If they live with pity,they learn to feel sorry for themselves.If they live with ridicule,they learn to feel shy.If they live with jealousy,they learn to feel envious.If they live with encouragement,they learn confidence.If they live with praise,they learn appreciation.If they live with acceptance,they learn to love.If they live with sharing,they learn generosity.If they live with honesty,they learn truthfulness.If they live with kindnessand consideration,they learn respect.If they live with security,they learn to have faithin themselvesand in those around them.If they live with friendliness,they learn that the worldis a nice placein which to live.27) As you rise with the morning sun,think what a precious privilege it isto be alive -to breathe,to think,to enjoy,to love.28) Value your own life and the lives of others.29) Be thankful.Happy Thanksgiving.Wishing You Many Blessingsand the Awareness to See Them.",40.7127837,-74.0059413,2015-11-30 04:40:41.287072,2015-11-30 04:40:41.287072,Google Places API

Maybe I'm a fool to feel it's knot over with the two of us as I hold on to that hope and faith that love does not fade when it's true love and that my loved one has my heart not willing to let go.

Even in the very formation of their claims.Seriously, if you're going to go off on a diatribe like you just did--choose 'safer ground' from which to preach. Rely on more solid examples to support your assertions.Most of your post is a rant against stalkers and harassment. Okay, fine. But you don't know enough about internet law to go around trying to scare people with threats of lawsuit. That's #1.#2, if you're going to take such an intellectual, lordly posture and waggle-your-finger down at the rest of us, you'd better know how to write intelligently. Halfway through your post you descend into pure gibberish. It was overly-wordy to the point of unintelligibility. Learn how to state your points succinctly if you want impact. Less is more. You kept reiterating your gripes--various ways of stating the same premise--and you quickly lost all the force you were hoping for.Finally, this theory of yours (below) is entirely thin. An 'audience' can certainly identify traits in a performer ...regardless of the performance the actor *believe* they provided.  The actor is the least trustworthy authority on what they conveyed with their performance. Audience input is the final --and sole--arbitrator of whether the actor was convincing or not.You can certainly follow the career of an actor and make all sorts of observations about their personality regardless of the roles they take up or the masks they don. It is merely ""actor's conceit"" to believe they are totally submerged in a role by the power or skill in their portrayal. Wrong: The fact that you think you can genuinely ""know"" a woman based upon the roles in entertainment she chooses to consider, e.g. she played a werewolf so she must be a werewolf, she played a bitch, so she must be a bitch, is just plain stupid and downright ignorant of you.It's a darn shame you don't want things hurled in your face, but this weak rationale of yours is not the way to undercut such public castigation.","","",2015-11-30 04:48:56.42738,2015-11-30 04:48:56.42738,detail page

In entertainment, when someone takes on the role of a script, it doesn't mean in any way that the actress taking on the role or script is the same person in real life or that you as a complete stranger have the right to know what she is like in real life. That's called her private life. If you're a stranger, you have no right to invade her private life. If you feel entitled to push and provoke in attempts to know her private life, it's called invasion of privacy, a crime punishable by law. Your obsessive actions also suggest coercion and duress.The fact that you think you can genuinely ""know"" a woman based upon the roles in entertainment she chooses to consider, e.g. she played a werewolf so she must be a werewolf, she played a bitch, so she must be a bitch, is just plain stupid and downright ignorant of you.If anyone seems ""shrewish"" to use your choice of word, I'd suggest that you first look at your actions. I doubt that if your disposition and actions have been kind, warm, giving, accepting, generous and understanding, you would have received a ""shrewish"", bad-tempered personality in return.If you've perceived a kind person as bad-tempered, perhaps it's because you have prejudged that person based upon preconceived notions to reflect qualities which are of your life and self, e.g. mean, vicious, cruel, invasive, and then projected such qualities onto her. Perhaps you resent or envy your differences. The bigger and more signficant questions are if you have perceived a woman as ""bad-tempered""why would you contact her again and again as if you're obsessed with her IF you're such a saint?Why would you obsessively be contacting someone with whom you are simply incompatible?Is that not harassment and abuse? Then, how could you expect to be logically received in a warm and open, welcoming manner?Furthermore, the overwhelming implication that guys at this site resent the subject of money as if it's not a basic reality and necessity of life from the moment you wake in the morning to the moment you end your day, a means to freedom and power, and a way to markedly improve your own life and the lives of others, suggests that their mentality, lifestyle and upbringing is something foreign to me, almost like a different language. Everyone in my world is all about the freedom that money provides - making it, investing it, spending it, donating it, spoiling others with it. To have enough money means the good life, to have enough to retire, to have enough to enjoy, to have enough to obtain what you need when you need it, to take things to the next level or improve your situation if it's not what it needs to be, to be able to care for others when they are in need. If you're not this type of guy and I make clear that this is the type of guy I seek, I'm doing you a favor. I'm letting you know off the bat that we're incompatible. Most people and relationship counselors consider differences in how you view money as relevant to basic compatibility. This doesn't mean that we can't perfectly coexist at the site along with our differences. In addition, the choices a woman makes are her business, not yours. All that should matter to you is if by the content of the ad and followup you seem compatible or not. If by the content of the ad you seem clearly incompatible or looking for different things, there's NO legitimate reason to make contact. This is clearly indicated under Prohibited of Terms of Use AND the option to check do not contact me with unsolicited offers. A role, product, or service has more or less value based upon what someone is willing to pay. That which is of the highest value is generally appealing to someone who can appreciate and afford it. Just because you don't see the value or are unable to afford it, doesn't mean everyone lacks the ability or interest.It's the general mentality of certain members of this site in regard to ads placed here that if ""you're not like us"", i.e. discrimination, and we dislike what you represent or how we perceive you, we will abuse you until you have no choice, but to leave, i.e. harassment, both of which are illegal in the eyes of the law. To name call and use incorrect terminology in attempts to demean and disparage a woman, i.e. verbalabuse, although the terms(s) as defined in the English language in the dictionary do(es) not apply, i.e. defamation and libel, makes you seem abusive, immature and dumb, it doesn't make the inapprpriate language apply. The offenders use abusive, vulgar terminology in regard to strictly platonic ads and content which is expressly written as nonsexual, and simply does not apply.I suggest that you be honest with yourself. If you have that much time on your hands to follow around the ads of and reply to someone whom you've implied is blatantly incompatible and bad-tempered, then what is missing from :::your life:::? Why are you not focused on :::your life:::?To be clear, I would have zero reason to pen this post if it wasn't for online stalkers and trolls making contact via cl relay email. I don't have the need to email people with whom I'm uncompatible. I'm focused on my best life. How about you?

Considering you're the audience to be reading this, I first wanted to acknowledge and greet you. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to pretend you don't exist, and proceed to write the following as if the only eyes to be laid on it are those of the person in question, which we've already established won't happen.Not everything in life needs to have a superficial meaning, so don't look for one.Here goes:I can't read you. Are you interested in me? If so, is it full-time? Part-time? Freelance? You do know that those with full-time status receive benefits, right? Part-timers get to attend uninspired meetings in a cheap effort to make them feel like they're included, and the ones who freelance, well, they're just taken advantage of and shit upon. I'm comfortable with you in any role - I just need to know which one you prefer, as I can then move to fill the other positions.**Please take note, the above doesn't necessarily pertain to a romantic relationship. It's all-encompassing.In fairness to you, I probably don't make the effort to read you, nor do I allow myself to be read. The reason for this isn't because I view this as a game, but because I'm not sure of how to advance, and therefore shy away from a situation in which I'd have to do so. There are many factors involved in this confusion. Here are a few, listed in no particular order:1) At this point in my life, I'm done with baseless alliances. I want something of substance, whether it be a friendship or more. I'm not sure you're at this same stage.2) There are other people involved - friends and family near and dear to us. Furthering things and subsequently fucking them up fucks those people up, too, probably creating one of those fucking rifts in which people feel as if they must pick fucking sides. That's a lot of fucking pressure not to fuck up.3) I like downers and you like uppers.I'm aware these are all issues that are easily solved by real, face to face communication.

I've always been wired that way, never understood the concept of casual relationships. Not saying that I'm expecting us to hit it off right away, only saying that my approach for meeting someone is always about whether we could fit as life partners. I'm saying I believe 1 + 1 = 3. I'm putting this ad out there in the internet ether, wondering if something tangible will emerge out of the primordial soup. I'm a very classic and total ENFJ. My perfect dinosaur would be someone late 20s to early 30s. Asian, Indian (yes, I know technically Indians are Asian), Guyanese, or Caucasian. Someone who is open minded, laid back, emotionally stable, who absolutely believes in monogamy. Someone who is comfortable in their own skin, down-to-earth, hilarious, thoughtful, nostalgic, and is mostly an open book. Oh and vital: be young at heart. Basically, I'm looking for the female version of myself. As for myself, I'm well put together in life, and every cell of my being is comprised of good-natured charm.

Everything truly does happen for a reason, sounds kitsch or cliche, but it works. The biggest lesson I've learned in my first few years of my 30's is to always just Trust your gut instincts. A foot in and a foot out, doesn't lead to a relationship, it only leads to doubt. DO I regret leaving? well, Yes! obviously. Not only did I disappoint you but I let myself down. I never gave myself the chance to see where things may have led. In retrospect would I have wanted to stay and keep those last 18 hours? Yes. absolutely. I think it would've solidified a lot more for you to be honest. It's my belief that even though you fight things in your heart and mind, and you can tell yourself NO I'm not ready a million times over....you really don't have a choice. Good, and bad things come when you least expect them. Do I wish things between us were different? not entirely, because I don't think in the grander scheme of things I made a mistake. I do just wish we stayed friends. It's really hard to find someone you can talk to about almost anything and let alone who has a Gilmore Girl DVD collection.

Here's some shared wisdom.If it's not for you, please don't prevent those who are able to be inspired to benefit from it. Thank you. To the person who contacted me to say she? finds it contradictory,it's because life is contradictory. There's no one-size-fits-all, not one reactionor one set of circumstances. There's only general wisdom you gain from life and experience.Just because you claim to not find the wisdom useful based upon your own miserable, angry self,doesn't mean others won't find the info enlightening and uplifting given their own experiences.We do not all lead the same life or see it through the same set of eyes. This should be obvious.Furthermore, circumstances in regard to gen'l online intertaction at this site do not applyto people in general in their own circle of life. Just because you relate to being abused and find it perfectly sound and natural, doesn't make it the case for everyone else. Some people have more respect for themselves and others and believe they are worthy of betterwhether they come from a hard life or not. Just because you're hardened and guarded and see that as ""normal"" doesn't make it the reality for everyone else. Some people see purity and kindness as freedom and anger and pain as a prison of your own making. That's a fact, not a judgment. The point of general wisdom is that you apply it where it suits you, where it provides you peaceand understanding, not to suggest that a wisdom applies to each and every situation in life. If you've interpreted the list to say that it applies to each and every situation and each and every person, then it looks like you're the one who needs an education. More importantly, you really shouldn't be so angry, especially on a holiday which is about gratitude. It's a sin. Yes, that's my opinion. It's my post! 1) Make peace with your pastso it won't screw up the present.2) Time healsalmost everything.Give it time.Or make peacewith yourselfto let it go.You're doing it for yourselfnot for the one's who hurt you.3) Don't compareyour life to othersand don't judge others.You have no ideawhat their journey is about.There are so many anonymous CL-ershere who are so quick to judge ratherthan accept that we are just different.If they allowed others to be, otherswouldn't have the need to return a taste of their own medicine. What do not judge is sayingis live and let live.If you are not judging in the first place,you won't receive it back.A person can be focused on her own lifeand there are strangers who seek to givetheir two cents and butt into it where itwas never requested. That's what promptsan article such as this one. 4) You can't go through lifebelieving that everyonewill understand you,relate to you,or even accept you.You can only voice your opinion.The difference between placing an ad and responding to an email is that placing an ad says you decide whether you wish to open it and read it,but if it's not for you, no problem skip it.Find something which works for you.An email suggests that you're on the same pageor why would you be bothering to email in the first place?So then when someone opens an email and it was unsolicitedand doesn't respect the request of what was asked, then it's judgment.it's alos in violation of TOU.What you say,how you feel,what you believe,what you haveDo not allowjudgment from othersto stop you from being you(if what you are doing is notcausing harm to anyone). 5) What others think of youis none of your business(so there is no point to email strangers when their ad does not resonate with you).6) Never stop believing in hope.Miracles happen everyday.7) The less you respond to negative people,the more peaceful your life will become.(When you speak out it's an ablution for yourselfand those who understand you). 8) A negative mindwill never give you a positive life.(People email others here even if they have nothing nice to saywhen it makes no rational sense to anyone).9) Perpetual optimismis a force multiplier.(Try kindness).10) If you keep focusing on what you fear,that's exactly where you'll end up.Learn to separate the facts from the pain.Be aware of the difference.11) Remember, it's not the conditions,but the decisions which determine our lives.Trust actions; words may deceive you.13) Silence is the best reply to a fool.14) The way of the miracle worker isto see all human behavioras one of two things,loveor a callto love.People who are in pain deliver pain.You can't fix other's problemsif it harms you in the process.Deception drains life energy.Toxicity poisons the soul.Accept situations whichare transparent and simple.If you ask direct questions,and don't receive direct answers,accept that the person is troubledand you will be a vessel for that painfor as long as you choose to stick around.15) One smile can start a friendship.One word can end a fight.One look can save a relationship.One person can change your life.It all depends on who is on the receiving end.Some people demand more of youthan you're able to giveor can afford to lose.By the time they come around,if they ever do,you no longer want what you had acceptedwhen it was first offered.Not everyone sees giving as receiving.You'll definitely feel it when someonehas trouble being pure in his giving.Your interaction will be riddled with confusionbecause the interaction is less than honest.Don't force it. Accept that what you see is the truthand release it rather than apply your energy hopingthat it's something positive.If you're receiving pain and confusion, believe it.If you're receiving kindness, warmth and generosity, believe it.Not everyone will be on your vibrational level.If you stick around negative energy long enoughit will adversely affect your own.Good people tend to be trusting because they are trustworthy.Online this can be a disaster if you run into one of many online fakeswho says one thing, but does another. He will create an image in orderto bait or interest you, but you will quickly learn that he doesn't keep his word.That's how you instantly know they're fake. Another way is that they'll attemptto place you on the defensive for their own bad behavior. I have a friend whodid his thesis on the subject of what is real and the fake profiles which exist online.That's just how prevalent it is. Beware.16) The way of the Universeand *its goodness*stills you,enlightens you,energizes you,andcalms you.Purity and goodnessdo notdeceive,condemn,confuseor use defense mechanismsto then blame youfor the energy they brought to the table.You may just be there in stillness taking it all in.Feeling drained and confused should be an instant warning.Honest communications and actions are not difficult to understand.Manpulative and malicious actions will confuse you if that's not of you.17) When someoneshows you who he is,believe him the first time.Do not grant repeated chancesto someone who has already failed you.It's far easier to work on yourselfthan to change another who hasn't asked.18) I heard earlier today that we speakand envision ""men"", but many people actmore like animals devoid of any self-controlor filter or care in regard to others,or deference to any religious figure or poweror spirit greater than themselves.There's no shame, guilt or fear.If you see the world as one way,and another operates on or was raised with opposite principles,it will be a challenge to understand or relate to one another.19) Should you ever find yourselfthe victim of another'sbitterness,smallnessor insecurities,things could be worse;YOU could be them.20) You can't reach for anything newif your hands and heartare laden with yesterday's junk.Let it go.21) The best thing about your past is thatit shows you what not to bring into the future.The people with whomyou choose to surround yourselfinfluence youwhether you like it or not.Choose wisely.22) Great minds discuss ideas;average minds discuss events;small minds discuss people.23) Let therefinement andimprovementof your own life,keep you fulfilledso that you haveno time to criticize others.24) If you expect the worldto be fair to youbecause you are fair,then you're fooling yourself.It's like expectingthe lion not to eat you,because you did not eat them.Conversely, it is ethical people who follow ethical principles,such as ""Do unto others as you'd have done unto you.""25) It's not what you look at that matters,it's what you choose to see.If it doesn't work for you,walk away.Your soul will never win if you allowa poisoned mind to damage your heart.26) If people live with criticism,they learn to condemn.If they live with hostility,they learn to fight.If they live with fear,they learn to be apprehensive.If they live with pity,they learn to feel sorry for themselves.If they live with ridicule,they learn to feel shy.If they live with jealousy,they learn to feel envious.If they live with encouragement,they learn confidence.If they live with praise,they learn appreciation.If they live with acceptance,they learn to love.If they live with sharing,they learn generosity.If they live with honesty,they learn truthfulness.If they live with kindnessand consideration,they learn respect.If they live with security,they learn to have faithin themselvesand in those around them.If they live with friendliness,they learn that the worldis a nice placein which to live.27) As you rise with the morning sun,think what a precious privilege it isto be alive -to breathe,to think,to enjoy,to love.28) Value your own life and the lives of others.29) Be thankful.Happy Thanksgiving.Wishing You Many Blessingsand the Awareness to See Them.","","",2015-11-30 04:53:18.255487,2015-11-30 04:53:18.255487,detail page

Idc if it's a fantasy or what ever the situation is. My heart has so much love. And this love belongs to you. Claim your prize lol. Happy thanksgiving I do wish the absolute best for you and your loved ones. And ummm I so desperately want to be one of those loved ones. Anyway Michele you are so beautiful imagine how beautiful you are to me as love= Michele. I would need so much help if you don't love me. Without you telling me the truth my life will be one big question with every thought hurtful as I was deeply in love with you and your smile and your cute nose. I know your smart strong willed stubborn as hell. Specially to me. But you know my life revolves around you. You my friend had my life on pause since 97. I had no thoughts of my future cause you were my stepping stone for my future. Maybe your right I am obsessed and dillisional and displayed stalking behavior but I need to see talk. To you as you are such a big part of it. How do I tell myself Michele wants nothing and will want nothing to ever do with you. When thoughts cross your mind there's no smile? There's no love felt from your heart to me. Missed loved is what you are. Let's just have the loved there. May your first bite of thanksgiving dinner bring a smile to your face from a happy imagine/ thought of terry. Thinking of you. It's impossible not to. You take 95% of my energy. And yes I have no plan. I need you to say hi then we could plan such a life. Maybe I'm a fool to feel it's knot over with the two of us as I hold on to that hope and faith that love does not fade when it's true love and that my loved one has my heart not willing to let go. Maybe being a cancer fucked me on this one as I can't let go of you. You mean to much to terry. He wants to kiss you. Brief words in between but kissing you is something I want so bad in this lifetime. K. No more Rampling or confessing how much I love you. Or how much I hurt. Just want you to know this heart has love for you. Has held wants to share. I love you. Well my heart loves you. I upset at you lol.

As you were near my table I was with a customer, fumbling over my words, feeling your presence around me. My body became nervous, and before I knew it you left. I watched you check out and exit. I thought I saw you glance back at me as you left. I wonder, was that connection two-sided?

""He doesn'ttouch me!"" ""I don't think he cares!"" ""I want to leave but I have nowhereto go!"" ""If I told him I'm in love with you he'd kick me out of thehouse! You don't want me to be homeless, do you?""And now even on your wedding day or on your honeymoon if he were to ask,""So you never slept with him?"" You would say, ""No! he's just a friend! He might have wanted to but I told him I was already in a relationshipwith you!"" Or some such lying thing. . .You and I know the truth, and that makes your wedding a lie.

I'm 32 years old and the only thing I'm missing is someone to share it with. Maybe I'll find that person here?I tend to be attracted to someone who has the same sort of personality and who is pretty laid back.It's tough to date with this disability though, I feel like that's an automatic dealbreaker for most people.

I'd like to chat with him some more and tell him a few things.

Except that I found myself unable to follow through, once again. At the time I did believe those things in totality. Still not sure what I believe. Nothing about you is solid in my mind. That is partly your fault. You rarely allowed me in. When two separate people with no knowledge of each other, opine pretty much the exact same things, you stop trusting your own (already proven flawed) instincts and give in to what you must believe is the truth.Life went on. I thought about you daily but had good control. A fair amount of time, never even came close to breaking. But.....That day grew nearer and I asked myself why the fuck am I noticing? I'm past it. Sure. I broke. I'm not sorry for what I said. You soundly professed your love for me, made me believe it in my soul, yet often treated me like I was not important to you. I'm also not convinced of it's truth. As mentioned, its all a blur, nothing concrete, weird for my type of brain. Some of it is probably true, some not. Idk.I know I still love you and hope your happy. Such hypocrisy. I've proven myself to be one. I'm ok with that. Love does weird shit to people. I'm just human.","","",2015-11-30 04:55:06.060716,2015-11-30 04:55:06.060716,detail page

I was having dinner with my friend in the corner booth and you were at a bachelor party with a bunch of your friends sitting right next to us. One of your gang asked me to take a photo of all of you guys. Lots of eye contact during the dinner. When we left I shook your hand and the future grooms hand. If you happen to see this and are interested get back to me. Tell me what I was wearing, and where in the restaurant we were located so I know that it's you .","","",2015-11-30 04:55:08.059614,2015-11-30 04:55:08.059614,detail page

I sensed a kindred spirit in you.I felt sad when you asked what my friend and I were getting up to tonight... as the conversation died and you said goodbye. I couldn't find an answer.I watched you walk into the distance. Inhale, exhale. Smoke.""Alidoro""I said to myself.You became smaller in the distance and larger in my mind. ""Wait what are you up to?""I wanted to say.Inhale, exhale.You began to fade away.""Just maybe...""I thought, I could run up and stop you. ""Odd""I thought, what for... Yet the thought grew heavy and here I am. I've never cared to write like this on an Internet message board before, yet some how your presence summoned up something I'd felt before. A kindred spirit. A friend for longer than a cigerette. You said I should go to the east village for music 20-26 was the scene.Don't remember where but the first floor was house, the second level indie rock and the third was a lounge.
