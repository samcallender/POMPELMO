I know you heard it SAT nite when I said I'll write you a note on Craigslist.I am the gentleman who stopped you on the sidewalk SAT night and said you look fantastic. I quickly introduced myself and told you my name is Chris.Please let me talk about the context of meeting you. I was on my way to the subway, coming from a party over on 2nd Avenue. I spotted you walking toward the intersection at 4th Avenue and 8th street (St. Marks Place).My eyes were stunned initially. I just liked your appearance so much. As you came to the corner the light was still red, and there were men on either side of you. Instantly I wondered, are you with either of them? Is one of them a boyfriend? When the light changed green, I saw you step away from them and breeze past me. I was almost dizzy with pleasure at seeing you jaunt by. But I snapped myself out of it in one second and instinctively turned around and walked after you. You were moving along at a pretty good clip. I almost had to sprint to catch up. What was on my mind? Three things. One --I wanted to compliment you on how great you looked, in a nice way that makes your comfortable. Two - I wanted to make it obvious I was intrigued by you and wanted to see you again. Three - tell you what I was going to do to try and make that happen (post a note to you here).I also want you to know Stef, WHY ..I am so interested. You are exactly, precisely my ""type"". Seeing you was not just taking in your prettiness, but your whole aura. Your bouncy upbeat cheerful energy. Your chic fashion style. I related to your presence with enthusiasm. Obviously I'm a little older than you, but, so what, que sera. I'm single. You're single. Life is what it is. We're in New York. Why not see what happens?I would luv to see you again. How can we do it? Any way that is comfortable for you. Lunch. Dinner. Drinks. Coffee? You name it. Hey the worst that can happen is that we don't; click. But nothing ventured nothing gained. I think we might. Because when I stopped you to say hello, even tho we only spoke for 10 seconds, you had a nice tone, gracious and friendly. So about me. I'm single, never marred. An entrepreneur in the entertainment and media world. A published writer. Former radio and TV personality. Fun, friendly, outgoing person. Like to do things. Have adventures. Enjoy life.Nuff said? Please email back thru here and tell me how we can get together soon. That would delight. Have a great dayWarmly, Chris",40.731300,-73.989200,2015-11-02 05:18:44.799395,2015-11-02 05:18:44.799395,

After all, it is said ""Nothing ventured, nothing gained.""At this point in time, I choose to remain safely hidden in the ""shadows"" by keeping my identity anonymous like most everyone else!!Yes, bold and yet still fragile...

I'm searching for a certain someone who just returned to NYC (welcome back!!) from the city of Houston. Though not native born to the ""Lone Star,"" a citizen of this country. And even way before, living in ""Magic City,"" for a time prior to landing among the cosmos of ""Space City.""... He had uprooted himself from his hometown, nestled along the southern, sandy shores of ""Strong Island."" Granted, none of this includes his time away at college.Though this clue may be seem vague to some, it could well be an obvious riddle to others... I've only shared here what most others may already publicly know-- hence, I'm no private eye or worst yet!! *gulp!!*As an aside... It should be so simple, right?! At least it should seem so, that in this modern day and age when the use of technology can close gaps, bridge the distances and connect us... Happens everyday, in this fast pace of life... Isolated to ourselves, just strangers passing glances.. When no one slows down for a moment to catch their breath, to pause or reflect... When most days, we're just too busy, always rushing and caught up in our own hectic-chaos. *sigh*Well with eyes wide open, I venture to engage in genuine communication, that's authentic and honest-- And with only the best of intentions!! Perhaps hard to believe, given this platform of introductions... Truth be told, I wish to see where this path may lead-- Even if this undertaking results in only creating a strong foundation in which to build a solid friendship that will last through the ages!! *smile*So with all that being said, here's to hoping that something positive will come from this somewhat ""shady"" attempt of finding that one single needle in the proverbial haystack of life!! *wink*If you are the recipient, to whom this post is directed, I apologize for my timing...

Embracing your madness and the things that might make you feel ugly or unloved, is sometimes exactly what you need to do, to overcome the turmoil inside yourself. Figure out how to make your flaws work for you, and let others see how you have turned a lemon into lemonade. Because they are in the same boat as you, everyone of them. And they will look up to you. I am a person, who loves flaws (certain ones). It's the largest reason I fell deeply in love with someone years ago. It was not all the good things about him, it was the flaws I saw inside of him. And he beats himself up over these flaws on a daily basis whirl-winding into a deep depression at times and then beating himself up for being depressed about it in the first place. I know for damn sure I'm not perfect.I'd like to know, because I know you see them, what are the flaws you see in me? Don't hold back. What are the flaws you hate most in yourself?

I am very sorry. It was Friday night, October 23rd, probably going into Saturday, October 24th. You were on the subway with your friend (another girl), but you caught my eye. I'm pretty sure I was never so infatuated in my life. Your laugh, your black leather jacket, your jeans, just your general kindness... I still can't get it out of my head. I followed you around like a little puppy-dog, totally lost in the moment, no idea where I was, other than that I was with you. Your friend left, looking at your longingly as she either transferred to another subway or got off (I'm not sure), giving you the, ""Will-you-be-ok?""-eyes, and you gave her the ""it's-ok-he's-harmless""-nod. I am sorry to even think that I took advantage of your trust, that I tried to buy your company. I was stupid, not in my right mind, and thought that I was hot shit in my blue suede shoes, navy jacket, slim fit khaki pants, pink shirt with white skinny tie. Little did I know how much it would eat away at me, the fact that we had a special moment in time, and I ruined it with such a cheap question...""I hate that it has to come to this, but how about a hundred dollars? Two hundred? Three?"" I literally wish I could go back in time and punch myself in the face so hard. I think you slapped me...I'm not sure. But I totally deserved it. If I had to reach down really deeply into my soul and think about it, I'd say that we both enjoyed that time together...the seemingly eternal yet infinitesimal space in time that paralleled the opening and closing of the subway doors, going up the escalator and my crouching down, to see you kind of amused, kind of scared... I am sorry to have scared you. I am sorry I was an asshole. I hope that you forgive me. And if, by some miracle, you actually see this or your friend that was with us sees this and passes it on to you, and if, by an even greater miracle, you reply to it, I just want to say this: if I could've changed any one thing, instead of things ending the way they did, I would've finished by asking you, ""Well, how about you let me cook you and your kids breakfast? I'm stranded, can crash on your floor, and will be up early to go get some eggs and pancakes and it'll be good; I'm great with kids."" You would've said, ""That is very sweet, but I will have to take a raincheck on that one."" We would've smiled longingly, as I hugged you goodbye.I am sorry. All the flowers in the world would not do justice to the type of apology I have for you, and one day, I hope that this message is somehow conveyed to you, the positive karmic vibrations sent through the universe SOMEhow... either through the kindness of another or a very lucky day, your kids doing really well in school (because I pray for them and you now), or you winning the lottery...SOMEhow...and I hope that even if you will most likely never know the good fortune may have occurred due to my prayers, you will feel happy enough to forgive all those that have wronged you or upset you, all in that one moment.",40.731300,-73.989200,2015-11-02 05:22:08.793239,2015-11-02 05:22:08.793239,

It has been there for two days now, I don't know who owns it, and it has all this stuff inside it (metal poles that look like they could be shelving or something) so I know you probably didn't leave it, but still, it reminds me of a fight that broke out in my house about six months ago and how I said I would have to move, and I do.I mean I really do have to move, and that's the problem, because I don't have enough cash to move right now (yes I found another job, but the stress of the whole fight, etc... is screwing with me enough that it is interfering with me at work :( HATE THAT!) so I now have to go out and find a new job (again) while I figure out a way to keep my shit together enough to save up enough cash to get a place by myself so I NEVER have to deal with another situation like that again. Never, never, never, never, never again.And there's this cargo van outside, a nice little light grey cargo van, (that I have never seen before and I vaguely recall saying something about a cargo van, but it is all hazy) just sitting there, innocently, almost like it is begging me to break one of the windows and Chicago punch it and drive away, and it reminded me of you. It makes me wonder if I told you how I would react six months after the big ass fight. How I would become almost delusionally fixated on you and that one moment where I totally lost my shit, and hence, am now, six months later, looking for a savior. I mean I know myself, I know what happens six months after the big stress event, and I know what the six months in between are like. So, maybe you came back and tried to talk to me about it and I was a total bitch, can't remember..... strange. I'm guessing that's what happened. (were you stupid enough to come back to my house after that fight? Didn't we have to lock my live in landlord in the psych ward because of that fight?) You hate me now for it all, I am totally sure of it.So, did you park a light grey cargo van with metal stuff in it outside my house? If so, can I crash on your couch while I pull my shit together, because I have a lot of unanswered questions and am a total nut case? (plus, my live in landlord has finally figured out that I hate him and started crying, I guess he figured out that he totally violated his gay feminist morals or something)Ummmmm, reminder, my dog has a Napoleon complex, but my roommates love him and will take care of him if you don't really want to deal with it.",40.7127837,-74.0059413,2015-11-02 05:22:55.857006,2015-11-02 05:22:55.857006,

I'm trying to ascertain if you meet my standards. You stated than insecure men misuse the term ""gold digger"", but you didn't give a proper definition of the term. Would you be willing to post what you imagine a ""gold diggers"" wish list might be? Then, in contrast, explain how your wish list differs? I am of the opinion that being insecure might not preclude someone from being able to identify a ""gold digger"". Do you disagree with my opinion on that? Also, do the words ""insecure"" and ""un-secure"" mean the same thing to you? I can imagine a scenario where a woman might be attracted to an insecure man if she thinks he comes from wealth, then breaks it off if she realizes he is less well off than she initially imagined. Would a gold digger admit she broke it off over financial reasons, or would she say she broke it off because he was insecure? Other than monetary reasons, what would cause a woman who hates insecure men, to date one? Do gold diggers ever misuse the term insecure? Is it safe to assume you are a banker or CEO, since you claim to know so much about them as a group? Or, are you making assumptions about a group you know little about? You seem to be claiming to have high standards. Are those moral and ethical standards, or just financial standards.

Or did you see me coming? You immediately opened your mouth to suggest I throw a snack into it, as if you were waiting for me to arrive. As if we were old buds. I noticed the beauty of your lips and your eyes, and though your gesture clearly signaled that you wanted me to toss a prune across the isle and into your mouth, I couldn't help but notice the erotic undertones of a woman displaying an upturned chin with mouth agape. Not that I misinterpreted what you were getting at--I knew a delicious sweet treat of dehydrated stonefruit was what you desired, nor did I take any particularly erotic pleasure from the moment. It was quite lovely and storgic. Like we were young playmates, blissfully ignorant of the blights of humanity surrounding us.Of course, I was more than happy to oblige. How often does one get such a happy opportunity?The first throw was too direct and lacked the necessary loft to come anywhere near your mouth. I was surprised and embarrassed by my lack of tossing skill because I'm typically quite good at body and object awareness. What good is a man who can't accurately lob a succulent dulcet bonbon of nature into a fair maiden's waiting maw? It landed impotent in your lap. You were carry a stack of loose (drawing?) paper, and I was worried I would sully the top page with a smear of reduced fructose.Eager to correct my error and avoid ruining your paper, I readied another dried fruit morsel and awaited your signal. This time, unfortunately, I overcompensated, throwing too hard: the dried plum flew passed your head smacking the advertisement behind you and rolling to the subway floor. I don't blame you for wanting to call it quits after this latest trajectory fiasco. Afterall, I just narrowly missed your face with a rapidly moving gooey projectile. I wanted to redeem myself, claiming that the third time is a charm, hoping to tersely imply that I now had a handle on the extremes of the throwing gamut and would be more able to find the mean of the two, ie. your mouth. But you probably rightfully protested, and we ceased our play. I really should have thrown underhand. I don't know what I was thinking.You ate the one that landed in your lap and said, ""Thank you for indulging me.""I said I was happy to indulge you. Then we sat there, with so many wonderful unknowns hovering about us. If I'd have had more energy, I might have engaged you in conversation about your day, but I'd been making conversation all day long, and I was tired of it. It didn't seem necessary. I felt as if we could have simply sat together without speaking, and been content.Who knows. It doesn't matter. I had a good time. You made the world feel like home and you made my night.

Been trying to catch a glimpse of your cock in the urinals and to drop hints every now and then. Not sure if you're actually interested. As we were heading down the stairs today, I finally got the courage to ask if we've met before. You didn't take my bait. Maybe you truly don't remember. We met at a video store a couple avenues away from our school. I was too shy. You grabbed your crotch and motioned toward one of the booths. I don't know how I didn't see you slip out of the store. Anyway, there was this one guy stroking off in one of the booths. I kept on thinking it was you. I really wanted to suck your cock. That desire hasn't gone away. Maybe it has for you though? The thing is, I'm partnered, long term and long distance. If you're okay with keeping it casual and discreet, it would be great to drag you into a secluded toilet stall somewhere in our school's building and give you a mind-blowing BJ. Or, maybe you can meet me at my apt, about a 15 min walk away from school.If you happen to see this, feel free to email me and tell me what you want, things that maybe you can't tell me in person in the library. I know this is a risk since we know each other's identity in some way. Hopefully we can keep this quiet? Or, maybe you can just hit me up at the library again, maybe tomorrow. You can say, ""hey, actually I think I remember us meeting before. Would you be interested in taking up my offer this time, by any chance?""

If you are - then literally wtf dude?First of all - the staring? Chill your eyeballs bro. I felt those things boring a hole in my cranium before I even noticed you. I get it, ya know? I was looking good yesterday. I snoozed through 8 alarms and stumbled out of bed 45 minutes late. I haphazardly slammed some makeup across my face and threw my dirty hair into a bun. I overdressed because I just moved back from California and I really don't understand the weather here anymore. Later in the day I got caught in a substantial downpour that ignited my frizz filled Jew fro and turned my bangs into much shorter, curlier bangs than I'd ever imagined was possible. Pair all of that with a little late 20's PMS induced acne and the general wear and tear of a long day and damn. I get it. I was looking fly as fuck dude.

I'm surprised anything tore me away from that book but it's difficult to ignore someone trying to move things with their brain à la Matilda or whatever you were doing. I caught your eyes and immediately felt something. It was mostly fear of impending doom because you were FIXATED but also you're not bad looking. Whatever. I'm lonely. I noticed that for some reason you had strapped your backpack across your chest like an overanxious high school freshman OR like Jon Krakauer in the best selling non-fiction book I mentioned was sitting in my lap. Suuuuuup fate?But you ruined it. Listen, I'm 28 years old and spend arguably too much time on my cell phone like most of my generation. This experience means that I am skilled in both taking a stealth picture (flash must be off, noise silenced, body slightly reclined so it doesn't seem like your phone's at a weird angle) and recognizing when someone is taking one of me. I appreciate your ingenuity and technique for sure: you rotated your phone and took multiple pictures in succession. To the untrained eye it maybe looked like you were wiping the screen or learning to juggle in a very inefficient way, but not me babe. I know you took a picture and I am NOT happy about it. Seriously? What part of my sweat soaked, rain drenched, frizz banged, and makeup-less appearance got you going? What did you need to commemorate so badly?

It was a culmination of three years worth of regret, embarrassed, disappointment, and rejection. The notion of you is great but at this point its just a dream...a forbidden fantasy. I guess the main reason why I'm writing here (when I vowed I wouldn't) is to clarify who I am for you. Your depiction of me speaks more about you than me and I realized that last night.I was scared I was gonna die of a heart attack or stroke. It was at that moment I realized I should be ashamed of myself. I have soooo much to be thankful for and so much going for myself and I shouldn't have let my emotions take me hostage like that. I layed beside my rock and thought about him. You have no idea how silly I felt but I'm glad I went through it. I have a different outlook on life. Shit, I'm good now. Lol Better than I've been in a while. You've purposefully gone out of your way to hurt me which is fine. Mission accomplished. What you don't understand is that I will be fine. I am fine. I have no dependency issues and my inner resolve and strength is far more in control than you seem to realize. I've never done drugs. NEVER. I never prostituted my body and never will. I value ""me"" too much for that. I have not been and never will be suicidal. I'm too STRONG for that. I have too much left to do on this earth to leave in such a fashion. I'm raising one of the most difficult kids ever BUT I think he will be one of the greatest humans to walk this planet. He deserves better from me and I vowed last night to give it to him.I know you saw me this morning and was surprised to see how well I'm keeping it together. You thought you broke me. No ma'am. After waking up this morning, there was a sense of relief and inner piece that I've been missing since falling in LOVE with you. Unfortunately for me but fortunately for you that chapter has ended and that door has been closed. I'm relieved and you're happy and that's all that matter. I'm not relieved you belong to another, I'm happy I've been freed from emotional purgatory. You freed me on the 18th and I thank you. I'm happy for you. It looked amazing. You're amazing and he's a lucky man to have you.Now its time I find my prince or princess :-) and move on with my life. I'm excited about the possibilities.

Since I will never be able to express this to him personally, just putting it out to the universe. Not looking for reply's or answers... just looking for closure. A relationship that will never be. A love that will never be felt. A friendship that will be lost forever. A moment in time that will never be recaptured. I can only hope that he finds happiness and love, just as I can only hope to find the same. All I would like to have is my heart back. They say that love doesn't get jealous, doesn't get vindictive, love always forgives, love endures through all test of time. Being in love is not just about the good times, its about all the times. Love doesn't hurt, it heals. The concept of two people being in love is what we all want. It's what humans crave. I read these ad's and sometimes find myself feeling bad for others. I hear the hurt, I feel the pain but often wonder why we can't all find ourselves letting go of situations that don't work. You can't blame another for your unhappiness, because ultimately we decide our own happiness. When all you have are dreams, memories, and heartache for the one that wasn't the one to begin with, then its all just an illusion. We have all hurt, and we have all hurt others. I've come to the conclusion, that me personally, I never want to hurt another person again. I don't like being jealous, I don't like judging others, and hope that for some reading this, maybe just maybe will change they way they think.Although there will always be a place in my heart for this person, I know that I cannot spend another minute wishing, praying, that my situation will change. It won't. So I'm taking a stand. My heart will be free and so will yours!Be happy...

These males will deliberately attempt to place women on the defensive in order to prey upon their conceivably latent insecurities. These males have nothing to offer the women in question so they seek out insecure women or berate, harass and abuse the women, because it irritates them that she is uninterested in someone ""like him"", a male who is alll alone and bored. How dare she!!!! He has nothing to do but troll and overanalyze, because his life is unfulfilled and he is bored and alone. Is it too difficult to understand why she has zero interest in him and why he is all alone? Look in the mirror and stop blaming her for your own shortcomings. It's all you, baby. If you could find a woman who is willing to settle for less, then you should have no time leftover between work, school, hobbies, social life and family (one or more), to contact women with unsolicited replies which do not meet the request of their ads. Your contact is all about YOUR shortcomings.If you lack the family and friends with whom to share experiences or discuss your problems, then find a therapist, or seek a non-profit social worker or read self-help books if you can't afford the cost, but don't you dare attempt to dump your baggage and issues onto me, a stranger, who has nothing to do with the root cause of what ails you. Maybe if you actually focused on being grateful and giving back when you're able, you'd actually start to feel better about yourself and not have the need to put down others, because you'll no longer be miserable. You're just looking for an excuse that has you running from yourself or from holding yourself accountable for all that ails you and how you are going to fix it. That's why you are attempting to distract and deter someone who is focused on what she wants and needs for positive experiences and progress in her own life.You run to a stranger whose ads you claim you can't stand, a strangerwith whom you possess next to no compatibility, rather than face your demons and free yourself for a better life. Think about that. Think about why you hate yourself that much and what you've done to fix it. Fix you instead of chasing after strangers who are leading their own lives. Stop running and deflecting. Focus on you and what works for your life and how you can improve itjust like I do and the people with whom I am compatible. We don't have hatred or envy of anyone, because it will not improve our lives one bit. You have one life to lead. That is your own. Hold yourself accountable for your choices and stop with the unsolicted replies that keep you running and from admitting to and facing your own demons and issues.I'm quite certain that no one here is a perfect person. Most people aren't perfect. Someone who is sending unsolicited cl email replies is certainly showing clear signs of being lost, alone and in need of help.Rather than sending those unsolicated cl relay replies, get the help you need. Become content in your own life so what women disinterested in you do with their lives makes no difference to you. You should be too busy working on yourself to hurt or bring pain to anyone. You should be too focused on what you want out of life to judge with unsolicated cl relay replies in regard to ad(s) to which you clearly don't meet the request(s), ads of a complete stranger whose real life you know nothing about. If any of those males had any real game or anything going on in their lives they'd be interesting to themselves, but they're just as boring to themselves as they are to women, because they have nothing going on in their lives and nothing to offer. So these males then attempt to place HER on the defensive for trying to make sense of a site such as this one and to use it in a way which makes logical sense to her. It pisses them off that she refuses to fall for the nonsense online where some males with no game or life make up stuff in regard to themselves to appear impressive or capable in some way even if they have nothing to offer her. There's a very bizarre dynamic online where certain males feel entitled to receive the attention and interest of women who in real life would likely not give them the time of day, so then when she attempts to raise the bar for such a lack of standards to see what he's really about, this pisses him off. The reality is that her type of guy in real life would NOT be perturbed by it, he's used to, and even compelled or intrigued by it. The further irony at a site such as this one is that the anonymous ""cl relay email guys"" don't realize that they've lost nothing if they're incompatible, so there's nothing to discuss. This is the general premise that had prompted this ad in the first place. I'm simply taken aback by how many males here don't have enough going on in their lives for themselves outside of anyone else, with or without friends, women, goals, fill in the blanks, it needn't be specific, but enough to be sufficiently fulfilled that there is NEVER a reason to contact a woman in regard to her ad(s) if it's to share anything less than pleasant or a reply which has nothing to do with meeting the request of the ad(s). This is basic common sense. If the content of a woman's ad suggests incompatibility, there's no need for debate, because there's no loss. But, instead there are males here based upon pent up aggression and anger who choose to let out the disappointmnt from their past associations and deflect it onto her when she has nothing to do with why you have the opinions you do of women or other people. That's your business, not hers!!! Find what you're looking for and leave her out of it. That's the point that should be obvious. It's when you get ticked off at a stranger based on the content of her ads which have nothing to do with you that she's compelled to say, ""What a minute, what's really going on here? What are these random strangers really saying when the content of your ad(s) has triggered them in some way based upon THEIR past which has them feeling that they should be taking it out on you as a complete stranger to them?"" Why are those guys not going to the source, rather than contacting a stranger? That's the point.I'm speaking specifically of the ""cl relay email guys"" who reply for no logical or constructive purpose.It pisses them off to see a woman who sets the rules for her own life whether it's work time or play time. It's HER life and it's HER choice. It pisses them off to see a woman who could not care less about what the majority have to say, because she is leading her life, and she knows what makes sense to her. This is what matters. Mind you that there are men here who have complimented my ads and appreciate that I place screeners on men just as I would in real life. They're obviously not the males to say, ""This is Craiglist"" to suggest that I can't place standards here. Says who? It's MY choice. I never ever said the contents of my ads are meant to appeal to everyone. The notion would be totally arrogant, just like the notion that any ad placed means it MUST BE for YOU. It's not logical.The premise is to each his own, live and let live and if it's not for you, find what's right for you and leave me out of it. Personal preferences and type of relationships or friendships which appeal to me is none of your business and vice versa. I simply find it ironic when a complete stranger via cl relay believes he should have a say. It's not your place. Focus on your life and the lives of those you care about. It's not your place to try to figure me out, figure yourself out. If you don't have anyone special in your life, find someone special. Focus your energies on things which matter, not to contact someone who you can tell by the content of her ad is incompatible to you on enough levels to trigger you negatively in some signficant way. Come on, we're are all adults here. You must realize what you're doing if you are honest with yourself. If a woman requires worthwhile feedback, she will take it to family and friends of her circle who she can trust based upon the good choices they've made for their lives, not some sap at CL who is abusing women, because he's bored, without a life, and shouting via his unsolicited replies that he's begging for attention, any attention, even if it's from a woman who clearly has placed an ad which spells out that he does not qualify!!! Imagine that, the kind of troll illustrated above thinks that HIS opinion should matter to a complete stranger!!!! The woman who has standards and logic for good reason is the woman they insist should be listening to what THEY have to say, the males who are attempting to disparage her or place her on the defensive. I don't know WHO you think will fall for your baloney, but it certainly is NOT a smart woman who leads her life. If you do not meet her standards, too bad for you. She just has more time to take better care of herself and become a better woman until she meets the kind of man who has it makes sense to free up her time.These offenders are so insecure the best they can do is call a woman ""names"", and abuse or harass her, because it is THEY who are powerless. They feel like nothing around such a woman, because she dismisses them. They will misuse the word ""gold digger"" as a buzz word to any woman who sets any standards for men, standards that well-raised men had already been taught in their upbringing or within decent circles of society. In reality this is not the definition of gold digger by any means. They create their own definition as a way to attempt to disparage a woman. Shame on you.One day you will have a daughter or niece and a male will abuse her just as you have abused other women. That's the karma you create when you disrespect women for living life on their terms and placing standards on THIER LIVES.It amazes me how some males are so insecure and have nothing going on for themselves so they troll others and attempt to delve into another's business even if they're strangers who have never met and with whom they hold no compatibility. The logic is just so disturbing.. but then again I suppose these males must be mentally ill and either don't see it or are so tortured by it, because they feel helpless and powerless in life, so they take it out on a woman of self-esteem who sets the rules for HER life.Rather than accept the reality of individuals online having differences on par with individuals in real life, and accepting these differences as basic incompatibility, OR a reason to step up, these trolls will instead attack and malign the woman and project their own shortcomings onto her. Real men have always been inspired by women. Men in my circle in real life are by-in-large, educated individuals who've had a good upbringing, good family, goals for their present and future, and financial stability. These men don't have any issues with me. These men all love me. Meanwhile, the trolls here seek to malign a woman they don't know based upon the standards she places in ads as a form of screener. This pisses them off enough to ""hate"" her although she is honestly just seeking contacts with whom she is compatible, no differently than she does in real life. She's not hating on anyone and honestly doesn't owe anyone an explanation. Women have become more and more capable and independent outside of the home as a result of more education and delaying marriage while desiring discovery and developing self-awareness and wholeness outside of men. This is a good thing. It means women are more secure and have more to contribute to their relationships as friends, colleagues, professionals, daughters, significant others, wives and mothers. This does not change the importance of men and their role to women unless males wish to be irrelevant to women and unimportant to themselves. Men who are secure in themselves as men, know their capabilities, have clear goals and plans for their futures, or already are financially secure and career-oriented. Such men find it second nature to treat women well as a basic form of respect and sociology. A smart women knows to choose such a man by default. A reasonable man doesn't expect a woman to be exactly like him. She's not looking to emasculate him and take over his role IF he knows how to fulfill it. She is who she is and that's all well and good. He's not looking for her to be someone she's not in order to win general favor. He's grateful for her femininity and all of the positive qualities which accompany it whether they have common interests as professionals or in their industries or not. This is a matter of personal taste in terms of what a man and woman find appealing in the dynamic of a relationship. This can also change over time as additional mutual trust is earned and their roles evolve.Eliminate the need for a man to care for a woman and a family and you eliminate some of the best qualities of women as loyal, caring, nurturing and supportive. The less a man is masculine in his interaction with a woman, the more masculine she will become until or unless there is a masculine man in her presence or life.A man who is in touch with the dance of men and women (le pas de deux) realizes that men are more simple and women have more layers and are more complicated (insofar as needs for dating and relationships). He realizes that men and women have differences and he accepts and embraces those differences. There's no point to attack a woman simply because you fail to live up to her standards. For every man who believes good men don't exist, there are other men who are very well aware that great men exist and are quite common in their circle. Once a woman has known a great man, then it's next to impossible to settle for anything less. The irony here is that the males who attack and berate, these males call a woman of standards who screens men as a ""man-hater"" when in fact most of what I've learned about males has come from men in my life who have been like big brothers to me and generally cared about me to tell me what's really going on. It is these successful men in my real life who have told me that no man is my charity case.If he can't treat me like a lady, and respect me in a way which meets my standards, then say bbye.The problem at this site is that the insecure males want something they can't have. Otherwise they wouldn't bother to contact me although it's perfectly clear that I have less than zero interest in them, other than to point out how pathetic they are for making me so important to continue to contact me despite my lack of respect for them. You see, I don't consider these types of males as men. In real life it doesn't need to get ""dirty"" or vicious. Men are rejected and screened all of the time. The powerful and successful men in society learn young that it's life. If they're smart, they become more powerful, more successful, and more charming where it's next to impossible for a woman to not take interest. It's only the trolls who are whining to me via cl relay replies, not the CEO's, ibankers, attorneys, hedge fund mgrs, RE developers, or any males with real control over their lives who actually adore or appreciate women. I always get along splendidly with the succcessful and educated man who doesn't harbor negative energies toward women. Why do you think this is? They have set standards for almost their entire lives so it's natural to understand a woman who would screen and set standards for hers and what makes sense in life, particularly at a site such as this one. Just because a website chooses to perpetuate the worst stereotypes of men and women (cheaters, alcoholics, drug addicts, sex addicts, swingers, hookers, the mentally ill, the illiterate, the ignorant..) doesn't make it the reality for all who visit.",40.7127837,-74.0059413,2015-11-02 05:31:01.483506,2015-11-02 05:31:01.483506,

""Are you okay?"" you asked, and I looked up with a very insusciant smile and said ""Oh yeah!"" and you hugged me and I hugged back, ignoring your sub-meridian.But when the job was done I slipped away without saying goodbye and ever since I've been on watch for a message from you because I know you wanted this week to pick up where last week left off - with you feeling noticed by me and feeling special, like there was something I wanted from you that I was willing to make a show and an effort for. I know you notice and feel some sadness when you don't get that from me. And I still fucking empathize with those feelings of yours.But what this most plainly suggests is that the excitement of these nuptual plans has already peaked, and you're now thinking about what you'll be losing, or already have lost. And one the biggest and saddest losses for you I reckon is my devotion, my attention, and my affection.This is how you are about everything. You want something so badly and make someone in your life who does care about you furnish that wanted thing. But soon after you get it you forget the thing and your wanting, and go back to what you always do - wanting broad social interaction and attention & approval from in as many ways and from as many novel sources as possible.And so I know what's going to happen; we will come together again - because you eventually will not be able to stand your new status quo (with mister supplicating steady provider who thinks he can contain and satisfy you, and therefore must not know you at all) - And that's the difference; I do know you. I see it all and though it keeps me at a distance sometimes, I still empathize and never judge you or ever give you any ultimatums.And we will come together again because even if I act insusciant at times you do have a very special space in my whole life and my whole being. Even though your fan club shit pisses me off I know we have a connection distinct from any of that, and I know you know it too. A primal, pherimone, inner-child, ancestral affinity. But I make you work for it sometimes too. That's why your smoke-and mirrors efforts to conceal your aging don't affect my feelings for you (though I know the naked truth better than all except that one guy who bought you that fucking ring).So what I'm saying is, despite this impasse and its limiting effects on our communication and candor, I'm anticipating being deep inside you again, feeling quite certain it will happen and also quite certain of the unique gasp from the bottom of your soul and spirit that will be emitted when that time comes.",40.748400,-73.996700,2015-11-02 05:31:53.562244,2015-11-02 05:31:53.562244,

She's just a girl who decided to destroy her body with excessive junk food, just a girl who found a box of red clown hair dye and decided to give it a whirl, who cut her pubic hair like curls right on top of her shoulders, who lives on Craigslist posting up one ad after another hoping to get laid by multiple men (doesn't matter who. just stick it in), who, again, according to my significant other was stalking him in Barnes and Nobles. Apparently, she had a crazy look on her face (which i've seen with my own eyes) and bulging fat pockets gone astray. What else are you going to lie about, K-lown? If you want to see her in action go to the Bryant Park (5th Ave and 47th St) Barnes and Nobles in Manhattan on certain days. Please go on the days she wears her special black dress and please tell her to take it off (not in the dirty way as she wishes everybody would want her to), but in the--go wear something more appropriate for your body type manner. Thank you! Oh, and make sure it's no raining. She hates the rain.",40.761546,-73.988604,2015-11-02 05:33:29.378771,2015-11-02 05:33:29.378771,

We sat outside until everyone was ready to go, and then went to your friend's apartment. It was on Ludlow, next to The Living Room, and had a pink gate. We stayed downstairs to wait for your friend to come back with beer while everyone went upstairs.Upstairs, your other friend played his movie while smoking cigarettes and joking about my friend who had fallen asleep in the recliner. You sat back and your arm brushed against mine. I pretended not to feel it, but had to turn my head away from you and shut my eyes for a few seconds. Then, when I went to cross my legs, my boot hit your knee and you winced in pain. My face went red, and you assured me it didn't hurt. I sank back into the couch and our arms touched again. Neither of us moved.The night went into morning. My friend suggested we go, and everyone else agreed. I ran after your cab and got your number. You went back to Brooklyn with your friends, I went back to the Upper East Side with mine.I was so nervous to call you, and when I tried a few days later and the number was out of service!

Eventually, you made your way over to me as I was looking for a pair of jeans that I had seen online and had trouble locating them in the store. I mentioned that another employee was previously helping me, but you clarified that he works stock. We then discussed colors of jeans and how I don't really like light clothing-- on me. But what I wanted to say is that light-colored clothing looks great on you. I wanted to say a lot of things to you, and I did manage to make a stupid comment about how my tee shirt was lighter than your pants, but I was really self-conscious since I had just come from the gym, felt kinda gross, and didn't think I looked my best.On my way out the store, I tapped you on the shoulder and thanked you for your help. But it was awkward since, at that exact same moment, you started to help some other customer. But you did say ""you're welcome.""Anyway, I'm sure guys must approach you all the time because of the high-traffic area where you work, and you're insanely attractive and you present yourself in a classy and open manner.

You were conscientiously, doing your best...for that long...to people you weren't ""trying to get something from"" in return?You gave your all. You didn't simply drop some lazy remarks in their hat, belittle their situation, or shrug-your-shoulders at their need for info. You didn't tell them to 'Google it' or 'YouTube it'. You also didn't break off to self-indulge in some lazy cellphone time-wasting of your own.

You're thoughtful. You're introspective and considerate. And you've recognized that I'm all of these things, too. So, what makes you ""just not into it,"" when you're into nearly every other half-employed option that passes by? It's confusing.I'm not interested in belaboring a point of preference. I respect it. I just wish I understood. At your party, I heard your friends saying ""That's V? He's cute!"" in the encouraging way friends say these sort of things. Like there's something about me you're averse to. But aren't we adults? Can't we be childishly, simplisticly, attracted? I'm not interested in politely reaching into the darkness to feel your disinterest. I'm interested in the girl who came across a crowded room to be alone with me last March. I'm interested in being the guy who liked you enough that he didn't fuck you in the basement the night he met you. Instead, I showed you that I was interested. I still smile thinking about how I caught you, falling through the trees in your skis. It was effortless for me. So, Rosie the Riveter... Be as strong as you look? We can do it. Since it's the 5th of November, Remember. Remember. That words can change the world. That behind the mask is not a man, but an idea. And that ideas are bulletproof. All that's left for me to wonder about now is how compatible we might really be. So this is my experiment:I've never mentioned that I troll missed connections before. But I do. Do you? If so, text me already; because (finally) this one was for you. ",40.731300,-73.989200,2015-11-09 02:30:36.262388,2015-11-09 02:30:36.262388,detail page

979,5290857588,Yellow raincoat on the B or D - wtf? - w4m,2015-11-05 21:43,/mnh/mis/5290857588.html,mnh,w4m,SoHo,"Are you the dude in the yellow raincoat riding the downtown D or B (I forget) yesterday around 7 pm? If you are - then literally wtf dude?First of all - the staring? Chill your eyeballs bro. I felt those things boring a hole in my cranium before I even noticed you. I get it, ya know? I was looking good yesterday. I snoozed through 8 alarms and stumbled out of bed 45 minutes late. I haphazardly slammed some makeup across my face and threw my dirty hair into a bun. I overdressed because I just moved back from California and I really don't understand the weather here anymore. Later in the day I got caught in a substantial downpour that ignited my frizz filled Jew fro and turned my bangs into much shorter, curlier bangs than I'd ever imagined was possible. Pair all of that with a little late 20's PMS induced acne and the general wear and tear of a long day and damn. I get it. I was looking fly as fuck dude. So I first noticed you when your dumb eyes were laser cutting into my face. I'm like 70% of the way through Into Thin Air so shit's getting good. I'm surprised anything tore me away from that book but it's difficult to ignore someone trying to move things with their brain à la Matilda or whatever you were doing. I caught your eyes and immediately felt something. It was mostly fear of impending doom because you were FIXATED but also you're not bad looking. Whatever. I'm lonely. I noticed that for some reason you had strapped your backpack across your chest like an overanxious high school freshman OR like Jon Krakauer in the best selling non-fiction book I mentioned was sitting in my lap. Suuuuuup fate?But you ruined it. Listen, I'm 28 years old and spend arguably too much time on my cell phone like most of my generation. This experience means that I am skilled in both taking a stealth picture (flash must be off, noise silenced, body slightly reclined so it doesn't seem like your phone's at a weird angle) and recognizing when someone is taking one of me. I appreciate your ingenuity and technique for sure: you rotated your phone and took multiple pictures in succession. To the untrained eye it maybe looked like you were wiping the screen or learning to juggle in a very inefficient way, but not me babe. I know you took a picture and I am NOT happy about it. Seriously? What part of my sweat soaked, rain drenched, frizz banged, and makeup-less appearance got you going? What did you need to commemorate so badly? It was creepy and weird (and sure I've done it like once) but you made me feel really uncomfortable after a long day. Not cool. But also you have really nice brown eyes and I've been single for a while. Tell me what random organizing thing you were lugging around and maybe we can get together and take pictures together or something.",40.7250796,-73.9990617,2015-11-09 02:30:38.923677,2015-11-09 02:30:38.923677,Google Places API

1015,5302179722,Pink Flamingos and This Mysterious Thing Called 'Love' - w4m,2015-11-05 16:48,/mnh/mis/5302179722.html,mnh,w4m,"","My dearest Eryn Gardens, Many moons ago, on a late summer night in the West Village, we spoke of alter egos and you had asked me what traits ""she"" would possess that I didn't already. ""Well, she'd be classier, sexier, more cultured. . . She'd probably wear pearls or something"". I asked the same question of you, and you told me that ""he"" would be braver, smoother, and more confident. . . Clearly, that makes two of us or I wouldn't be writing this letter to you, hoping it'll find you well. Instead, I would have grabbed you by the lapels and matched my lips to yours that evening we explored Little Italy for, what felt like, the first time. . . or finally worked up the courage to confess my growing emotions that night we watched one of our favorite shows on your fire escape months ago under that summer moon. The other evening, you had asked me if I'd ever truly been in love. ""Yes, just once, I suppose"". . . .But, that wasn't an entirely honest response. I asked the same question of you. ""No, I don't think I really ever have"". You mentioned the difficulty distinguishing between love and familiarity. I told you my philosophy on soulmates. Love's a funny thing, though. . . I've always chalked it up to lust and comfort and familiarity. But, you have to admit, there's something far more mystical about it. . . I recall a very early morning in late June. We were on the J train. . . You know that long haul between Marcy and Essex. . . You and I were traveling home after a long night of filming in Brooklyn and I pointed out the breathtaking view of the city. We took a break from our banter to take in the sights. You thoughtfully took everything in. . . Wandering in between train car windows to catch every possible angle. Anyway, there are a few things I never told you about that day. . . The evening prior, on my way to that very shoot, I rode the same train and admired the same beautiful surroundings. The moment was picturesque. But, I remember thinking ""I really wish I could share this with someone. . ."" Someone who would genuinely understand the loveliness that was surrounding me at that exact minute. That exact second. I felt so very fortunate to be able to share that moment with you. And, to be honest, watching you find the beauty in the exact same sights I had only hours earlier, warmed my heart. And, another thing: In that 4 minute journey into Manhattan, as we watched the cars and buildings sail passed us, the same excitement a small child feels on Christmas morning overtook me. I knew in that exact moment that I could love you. We were mere Subway Buddies then. In the time since, you've become my partner in crime. My rock/paper/scissors. I joke about the first time we met. . .. You rolled your eyes at my lame attempt at a joke (though I know you'll claim you never did such a thing!) and I thought to myself ""there's no way this kid and I are going to get along!"". Turns out, I couldn't have been more wrong. . . We ended up with a relationship far more dear to my heart than I'd ever imagined. The last thing I aim to do is scare you off with my overly flowery words. . . You know how us writers can be! I just wanted to let you know how very special you are to me, my dear. I've attached no ultimatums or pressure to this letter; only my most honest of thoughts and feelings.

1020,5301927734,So today... - w4m,2015-11-05 14:24,/mnh/mis/5301927734.html,mnh,w4m,New York,"Just now. Im here trying on shoes at the store. I walk over to the mirror, leaving my worn shoes over at the seat, along with my shopping cart with my personal belongings. As Im looking in the mirror, I see this elderly lady-morena kicks my sneakers over to plop right down on my spot. As she sits, she has her foot rest on my sneaker. Usually, I wouldnt say anything but take my things and move over to the next available seat. But I couldnt even do that, being that she so effortlessly had her foot resting on my freaking sneaker. OK. So I go over and tell her ""Miss, you're sitting in my seat"" She looks at me and goes off. I tell her, ""Miss, you can have the seat, for thats not the issue here. The issue here is, I seen what you just did-you kicked my shoe and now youre..."" The old lady, didnt even allow me to finish my sentence w/out her making me look like the worst kind of individual for arguing with an old lady over a seat. Thats the part, that igged me. Instead of just acknowledging/apologizing, no she'd rather argue, play the old lady card like a loud-speaker;despite my telling her directly the issue. Ofcourse I wouldve let it go from jump, but the fact she can muster all the energy in the world to not allow me a word in edgewise, to argue me down b/c gues what-I can speak English; was the reason I had to call her on it. When she seen I wouldnt let the issue go until she'd apologize, she got up but not without calling me all types of names under her breath, my favorite-""jackass"".This is where I responded with ""Yeah youre lucky, you're 100 yrs old..."" Her grandson or son (?) jumps in and says ""Or you do what?"" Then we go at it. I point out, if the tables were turned and if I wouldve kicked her shoes to the side, to sit down I wouldve received the only curse-out; no questions asked. And yes, I did bring the race card. Threw in their face, that the reason that ""they think they can get away with it with us, is b/c we're Hispanics"". Then he pulls out ""Do you have your diploma, you sound real uneducated""So wait a minute. I'm ""uneducated"" for pointing out the obvious. For finally speaking up for myself. Cause this type of treatment has been going on for the ages. We, always kept our mouths shut. Let it roll of our backs. Why? B/c at the end of the day, its not worth getting into it with 'savages'. So now, when someone defends themselves, we're labeled as ""uneducated"".OK.I have a friend/Spanish whose no more than five feet tall, if that!! Tell me why, she was constantly bullied in front of her kids then finally jumped so bad in front of her kids; that she suffers from health complications as a result. Had to move elsewhere. And guess who jumped her?I had another friend, that while she was walking with her nieces and nephews and her kids was jumped with all of them, at her side. She moved elsewhere. Same flipping problem. Being bullied relentlessly. Guess what she is? Guess who her bully is?My prior apartment dwelling. Bullied, taunted, humiliated on a constant for yrs by a grown woman with grandkids. Effing twice my age. Always showed her a's in front of my child, where I wouldnt budge cause as a mother, I'd rather look like the punk than for anything happen to us. Yet when it was only me and her and I approached her. Nothing. Not a peep. But as soon as I was with my child, she took advantage.And you threw how our worst fault is how we dont speak English. OK.Well maybe perhaps, some of us dont speak English. But what about the majority of those, who do match your skin color who speak the English very well. Well enough, to curse and call eachother ""Nigger"" and communicate via ebonics/street slang. Yeah those whose life purpose-despite growing up here, where we are rich in resources for getting ahead, college-wise and so forth-instead inspire to grow up to become high school drop outs, have kids out of wedlock from like ten different baby-daddys and run game on the welfare system? Yet theyre the same ones, screaming and hollering about police brutality. Theyre the same ones, cursing us out and quick to call us ""illegals"" The same ones, to pin us with African ancestry but in denial due to embarrassment-type-crap. The same ones, that are society throw-up; meaning drug dealing, keep the streets dirty and who dont know how to clean after themselves-no class, no education, nothing civilized about them whatsoever. And yeah-Im saying it.They're like, what is it that you called me many moons ago when you were out, smelling yourself...oh yeah ""Gutter Trash"".No more moreno-loving days for me. No mas. Im done. People arent born, hating. Its created. Now I understand many, many things thru the eyes of many, thru their description.And yeah, we may not speak English. The majority, they get married first, have kids working household and instill in their children to become productive model citizens in society. And if we do wrong, we're quick to point our faults. We dont sweep them under the rug and blame society for our hindrance. We do what we have to do. We're 'hungry' too. But we dont kill our own people via drug selling, leave our ""baby-moms"" to fend for themselves, nor treat any other races w/such effing disrespect. So you want to preach to me, police brutality...gee boy genius, is there any wonder the driving culprit? Here's a hint: Its not racism. And tho some police officers are rotten, but the other side of the story, carries responsibility as well.And then its not even you, not even you whose been writing me. Not even you. Oh and before I forget-you were quick to throw how my race is the worst, yet when we were dating-you never ceased to remind me how I was the very best you ever had. Now we're all the worst, all cause why....cause you married a morena. Really?! #FOHNever ceases to amaze me no matter how college/ivy-leagued educated an individual may have, they're like the worst in their ignorance. Youre preaching police brutality. Do you know just how simpleton of a joke, you sound. Like that vast amount of knowledge you racked up, and yet, still dont know how to use/think outside of the circle to think, for 'yourself'.Ninkumpoot.Not so long ago, I went to a job interview. Good job, w/the government too. The supervisor and I, hit it off immediately. I remember, leaving my jacket in a room where with whom I was introduced to, well I left my jacket there, while the supervisor gave a tour of the plant. Tell me why, when I was at the turnstyle with my jacket in tow, I had been left with empty pockets. Meaning-my metro card was stolen. Like really? Youre going to steal a lady's metro card??? And I know it wasnt stolen out of needs. It was straight malice. I declined the company's offer. Wasnt worth swimming in such sea of malice. Never bothered saying anything. But now, I'm going to email the supervisor to report 'em. B/c Im female and Hispanic. Youre going to dig into my pockets and have the nerve to steal a measling metro card, to screw my day over. Like thank goodness, I brought my purse with me.Le fuq am I doing, still on this site then. This craziness, you persist in having me entangled, does not pertain to me.Now more than ever, I know what I have to do.Its just the more I experience this crap, the more I see how flipping ruthless and disgusting your kind truly are. You all, would back stab me/our kind in a heartbeat. No regards no nothing. Savages.I swear to God Stan, Fuck you.I would say all of this directly, but alas due to limited open communication-yeah yeah we know. With that said, if you ever, ever once in your life ever EVER held an ounce of any ""love"" thats geniune, Im telling you, to please do not bother looking for me in the real world. Leave me be. I geniunely do not want anything to do with you. Ever. Dont bother looking for me. Nor bother to show face.To my sister-Word to the Wise-if you think they won't betray you, you are deadly mistaken. Other than that, when was the last time you spoke to Papi>? Lets pray, that you'd never ever end up on your death bed, puking up your lungs, liver bile; begging for air, but taking off that oxygen mask, so youd be able to die quicker b/c the pain of it all, is just too great. And just pray, that someone for whom you sacrificied so much for, never swears on your grave.Fuck you.",40.7898495,-73.9710789,2015-11-09 02:31:26.442692,2015-11-09 02:31:26.442692,Google Places API

You're going to email me about 'corrupt cops' against morenos and critique every other race but your own? Seriously??!?! Seriously, well that explains why you still have asswipe still on your FB friendlist then.I gotta add before anything, this is the reason why right here as Im sure my hermanos y hermanas are feeling it as well. But this is why, we have to stop bigging up these African American tv shows; showing them support and showering with media credit, when we post on social media. We so have to stop that altogether. Because 1- You never ever see not one African American bigging up any Hispanic in any way or form, in anything. 2- They're ALWAYS the first ones to bad-mouth our hispanic 'idol' celebrities, knock us to 'trump' over their matching skin celebrities. 3- We just need to start and stay representing our shows/etc; like we're never in the main stream in terms of tv shows/etc and why, b/c we hide behind these black shows giving them props on media outlet but wonder why, we can still count on one hand on how many Hispanic celebrities there are and why we are practically non-existent and why, society still refers to us as the cooty-illed illegals bringing this country down. When in reality, we are more than just ""toilet-cleaners"". And we are. Its just time, we owned our titulo. As for you, well thanks for allowing this vent. Thats one good thing that came out of this whole cl saga. That asswipe, you still have on your friendlist. That screams volumes. What he did. Lets put it this way, if the tables were turned I so wouldve deleted him off my fb-friendlist. Its not even about the romantic attachment between us. We couldve been purely platonic. But its just knowing your character, your struggles and the angle from where this asswipe was throwing his jabs ESPECIALLY knowing *his history* (like seriously, you gots nerve to talk??!)-I for one, would not had kept him on my friend list. You keeping him there, speaks volume. And I shouldnt have to tell you, or pitch a fit, that shouldve came from you. Not from me, telling you.Then again, what more can one expect who listened to a boricua, who told you I wasnt good for you. And you listened, no questions asked. Oh and your moms and sis. You mentioned how they were against us being serious back then, yet...yet-YET...I'm good enough now?! Gee. I wonder how that happened?!And see, unlike you and your people I do understand to a certain extent where your fam was coming from at that time. I do. Altho doesnt make it any right, nor pacifies the here-and-now tho.Its just YO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!All of this that we find ourselves in-You and I-when it comes down to us...couldve been so avoided if you'd just pulled up your man-pants and communicated with me in the real world. Instead, Im here alone on my end of my computer screen; venting what time left me with all due to your refusal to give me face. Now aint that a bitch!Its not even about the race thingy. Its about what I'd have to put up with, in the aftermath of all this. Red flags, never ceases to remind me that at the end of all this, I am only fooling myself when it comes to a happily ever after when it comes to us.Now that I myself, is coming out of that ignorance pool, I'm taking in how experience is the only motherfucker when it comes to teaching one, truth. To bypass what life's lessons in strength of 'love'...my gosh, what did I ever learn in the first place in doing so.You point out police brutality-me, for once I'd like to see for once, one black person doing the bitchin' point out what their race need to rectify in order to evolve as a whole. Yet as fast as they are at spitting on us, theyre the same ones to jab us with we're Africans then lynch us w/we're prejudice but in all, what they/and now you, fail to realize is, look at the source.Personally, its been day in and day out w/what Im fed about. I had an African American friend, who warned me about this eons ago, to which I really took as exaggeration. But now, nowhere nears of sorts. From my past relationship, I remember going thru it with my 'mother in law', who nitpicked my physique, who one day I so had to put her in her place by pointing out her daughter's well-rounded figure. Again, goes back to my rant earlier. Its like how much more can a person take with this crap. To only solidify this 'crap' indefinitely, by allowing your life to become mine?!!No. Can. Do.Let me clarify-theres bad apples in every race. Mine too. But its gotten to the point of no return-to say the least. Its like enough already.And if this is what I'm ""experiencing"" now-alone. And if your fam/friends are a certain way-alone. Taking into consideration, my other gripes, how you never listen. You never listen to me but to everyone else. What happens when we have problems in our relationship? You'll do, what you always do, run to one of your hen-friends who happens to be black who looks at me side-ways, for advice. Really? Leaving me, with no-sayso. As usual.Gotta ask myself. Do I really want to spend the rest of my 'pretty years' spent, w/a muzzle?! My so-called other half never takes into account, what I have to say, my wants and my needs cause Im not black enough or perhaps I dont know how it is to be black or simply Im not black, period. Thats just a gist. So you'll go to this hen friend, who happens to be black for advice b/c its how you roll. You go to everyone else, but the source, me.Why do I feel this...why? Cause its the only actions youve given me, time and time again. Back then, I was a spick. Not worthy of you, for such and such reasons and instead of listening to your heart, you listened. You listened to someone who had no geniune intentions towards you. Who succeeded in jypping you, out of me. Yeah-thats one. And for a great while thereafter-I remember, I wasnt good enough cause, well cause I was a 'spick'. You cock-blocked me at every turn whenever I attempted to win you back, cause well, I was a spick who wasnt good enough. Left me, for someone who matched your skin color. Still played that unfiltered fool for you, yet you still wouldnt budge, cause why???Yeah. I remember.And yet still, instead of just coming back to communicate directly like any sane person. You wouldnt speak to me in reality but stayed posting here. I said, I didnt want to do cl any more, you kept me here for ...whats that, think its going on to siete jodio anos.Whenever I called to get to the bottom of this, mayhem you hung up on me. Then laughed about it among your many posts here. You stalk me, when I went to the police I was the one arrested. You laughted about it. My mother died, yep you laughed about it and effed with my head ten times more. You told me, at my lowest to commit suicide. Then chase that comment with lovey dovey posts, filled with sentiments of sweet dreaming and far-fetched love.You laughed and made a mockery, at my pain. Aside from this mind-fucking cl world, you were trying to suck me in. In my world, where were you??? Where were you, when the stacks were down, where were you, when I needed you? Where were you, when the world was against me and I had to fend for myself...where were you??? Oh how I tended to forget-I'm a 'spick'. So you never bothered to look at me twice. Where were you? Oh busy sticking it in the morenas and white girls. Oh but I should feel special then, cause by the looks of it, I was the only Latina you ever looked at, huh?!!! As Im sure, if I never came to the picture, youd be married to a white girl. After going thru what Im going thru, cant say I blame you. Sad to say, but true.And even if,,,,even if the fairy tales youve written were ever true, I would always have to live my life second-guessing your actions. Who the eff, wants to live life like that???You never listen. You never take my words, with respect and value. And its not as if, Im swimming in success as Im sure theres always lessons to be learnt, such as life and still consider myself, a work in progress but if Im here, I arrived here on my own...alone.You never bothered to pick a phone. Not even snail-mailed me. You laughed and labeled me as delusional when I tried to contact you. Like what excuse in the world, do you have to rectify these actions?? I wasnt good enough for you then, so you know what, Im not good enough for you now either. You never even tried. Not one time. Not one. You listened to everyone else. You allowed everyone else decide the affairs to your heart.And tho despite me telling you directly, that the only thing you ever had to do was just come back. Fucking simple. Just come back home. You never did and you still wont. Something so simple. All I asked was for something tangible. Something real. And youve given, not one.So time is egging me w/""WTF are you still holding on to???""And I cant find not one reason to, not anymore.~Thank you for that.",40.786340,-73.963053,2015-11-09 02:32:38.204249,2015-11-09 02:32:38.204249,Google Places API

1099,5300795612,Brunette in Central Park near 72nd Street - m4w,2015-11-04 19:03,/mnh/mis/5300795612.html,mnh,m4w,Upper West Side,"I was walking through Central Park this afternoon when I took a detour toward the west side. I was at the statue of the Falconer near the 72nd Street entrance when I sat down for a few minutes. I had on jeans and a dark green shirt, and I was carrying a brown leather jacket (it was warm today, even for this time of year.) I dropped my newspaper, the pages blew everywhere, and you ran over to help. You had dark brown, wavy hair, and a black coat. You were wearing a green skirt, or maybe a dress - your coat was buttoned, so I don't know which. In the moment, that's all I saw. I was too concerned, I suppose, with making sure I didn't lose my newspaper to the horses. It's not often that I spring for a copy of the New York Times. The breeze was strong, and the pages were blowing everywhere. But looking back on that brief interaction, there was more. I already had Real Estate and Dining & Wine tucked under my arm, and I didn't notice at the time how you laughed when we both reached for Weather; it was the same way you used to laugh on the playground. You could run faster than all of the boys - even me, and I used to tell everyone (like an idiot) that I could run faster than the wind itself. When you handed me the pages you'd picked up I didn't really pay any attention to your fingernails, but now that I think about it you used to bite them as a child, too. Nervous habit, I guess.I'll know you when I see you, I've always thought. I know I will. I have known it for twenty-seven years and that's how long I have been looking. It was the only thing I knew for certain other than the fact that I hadn't seen you yet, or if I had then I hadn't seen you fully.But really that's only a half-truth. I did see you once when we were younger. Well, technically I saw you almost every day, but there was one day in particular when I saw you: a single glance across a classroom, and you were looking back at me with eyes that were quicker than mine, smarter than mine. I knew you, then, but it was just a glimpse, and I thought I couldn't trust it. I didn't know I could trust it; we were only kids, after all. I looked away, and I've never been sorrier for any mistake I've made thus far in my life.Your eyes today - I don't know how I didn't recognize you in them.When you and I disappeared from each others' lives so many years ago, I didn't think of you at first. I'm sorry to say that most days I didn't think of you at all. Ashamed, if I'm being honest. But after a time - I can't say for sure how long - I started thinking of you most days. And then I started looking.I looked for you around corners. The corners of buildings, I mean, because I was still a boy too afraid that you would see me first. Now I'm older and smarter than I was, and I've learned to look for you around the corners of my mind while I walk north on MacDougal Street. I always throw quarters to the folk singers and shoot the shit with the old timers at the chess tables, and I always stop to talk with Dierdre who lives on Amsterdam Avenue but has sold hats on West 12th Street since 1974. (I wonder if Dierdre is her real name.) I never walk up Sixth Avenue because I prefer the closeness of Fifth and on the periphery of it all I always, I always, I always look for you.The ages have passed while I've walked these streets. I've seen thousands of faces, millions perhaps, but none of them were yours. I'll know you when I see you - I was sure of it. I convinced myself that I wouldn't even mind if you didn't know me right away. But I thought you would. I hoped.The park is for tourists, and families, and lovers, and secrets, and me.I don't always visit the Falconer. It was more of a coincidence that I turned in that direction at all. Most days I'll wait for you at Bethesda Fountain, but when I'm feeling masochistic I'll turn up at Rat Rock. When I can't take it anymore I'll stop looking altogether and walk through The Ramble until I get lost. (I can't get lost; I know those paths.) But it was the Falconer today, because during these autumn afternoons I like how the statue nearly escapes everyone's notice. I sat to his right, my jacket beneath me to dull the cold ground. I opened the newspaper I'd brought with me; since I hadn't seen you yet, I had to fill my time somehow.I'll never admit it, but I'm good at the crosswords.Sometimes I've wondered how often we've passed by each other looking in opposite directions; or stood on opposite ends of the same subway car; or sat at distant tables in the same bar, both of us drinking whatever's on tap; or; or; or. Sometimes I feared you didn't even live here anymore, that I'd wasted all these years for nothing. I looked into each face - I don't know you, I don't know you. I can't stay if you're not here, but I won't leave in case you are.I sat there on the grass, waiting, because that's mostly what I have done these many years - even while doing other things, really I'm always waiting to run into you again. At times I've wondered if there's something wrong with me, to spend half my life looking for someone who might be looking for someone else. Anyway, I must have been distracted by the leaves raining down, so when the wind picked up I lost my grip on the newspaper. The sections came apart mid-fall and landed scattered across the walking path below my overlook. Some people were startled - they really don't notice The Falconer up here, out of the way - and I jumped up to collect the pages before they blew into the street and I lost them to the horses and - oh, you know the rest.I saw you, but I didn't know you. I guess it's my fault; I wasn't paying attention. I guess you weren't either. So maybe we're both to blame. You know, sometimes I wonder if you're even looking. Hell, I'd stay in one place if I knew you were.",40.7751137,-73.9826513,2015-11-09 02:33:03.232726,2015-11-09 02:33:03.232726,Google Places API

In the being you would sneak me into your place. I would get ready in your bathroom then have you take me into you room. I remember the first time. You FUCK me so hard, I was in love from that moment on. Our best moment ever, and at the top of my list, was the time it was very late, and you wanted me to come over, but your folks was home. I parked across the street from your place, and you had me come in through the back door which lead to your unfinished basement. I remember how dark, dusty and cold it was. We made out on the old leather sofa. Then you got rock hard and made me to blow you. I took a hit of poppers the moment stood up and throw a towel on the floor. You fucked me so hard that I couldn't keep still. You pushed you palm into my mouth to try to quiet me. We broke all our condoms that night, a common theme in our sex affair. I was covered in your sweat and dust. I still get hot thinking about it. The sweetest part, hours later when we were done we split a can of Spite. We hung out a few times after, but then lost contact. I really hope this letter finds you. Sexual we're a match. You were the first person to 1.) Love my look and 2.) Keep up with me in my sex life. I didn't mean to scare you off with asking about a 3way. I caught up with the idea of having someone see how well you fuck me. I'm sorry.Please find me, I would love to see you again.

I wanted to say a lot of things to you, and I did manage to make a stupid comment about how my tee shirt was lighter than your pants, but I was really self-conscious since I had just come from the gym, felt kinda gross, and didn't think I looked my best.On my way out the store, I tapped you on the shoulder and thanked you for your help.

I fantasize about you so much- singing with you, kissing you, or just staring at you.Me, swf, auburn/chestnut, naturally reddish/blondish/brownish tri-colored long hair that glints of phosphorescent purple in the light, green eyes, 35, 5 ft 7.Busty/curvy in the right places. I live in America, Brooklyn/NYC... I'm a singer myself. Willing to travel or have you come here. I realize you are probably a bit younger than me. I am very young at heart, however, and I don't mind sharing you. I don't normally go for younger guys either, you would be the first time I did. Check out this song (on Spotify), it's how I feel about you... let's sing this together... ""Beautiful Birds"", by CANDIDATE, on one of my favorite albums of all time, Nuada.Or better yet, ""In Love With Love"" by Gregory Page. I wish I would have talked to you more. You will live on in my memory... until I forget you.","","",2015-11-09 02:56:20.731884,2015-11-09 02:56:20.731884,detail page

I was standing talking with a friend.You got up to leave, we looked at each other, you smiled, approached, and handed me the silver metal object you had found in the cork. Time stood still. I asked you why, holding cork pieces in hand, falling one by one to the floor. My friend mentioned we were both being tactile. You and I talked for a moment, then the usher rushed the three of you out. In a hurry, I asked if you'd like it back and you said yes.I was so blown away by the moment that I couldn't pull the words out in time, to ask your name and to see you again. Later my friend said he thought we knew each other and yes, in a way it felt like we did. I love that feeling.Hoping you or your friends see this so we can meet again. If by chance this happens through here, please tell me what it is you handed me...You: About 5'7"", long, brown curly hair, light brown complexion, mixed ethnicity I think, thin body with curves, black long sleeved top, black pants, black sneaker / moccasins, pretty large black bag on shoulder.

Something juicier than a couple of riots, a couple of rapes, a cross burning, a trip to the psych. ward, and a gallery showing.I think I'm just a little pissed off because the plot is so thin and I have this burning desire to write this gaddamn thing.sigh.

I had on a black cat outfit and I wore a long, black fading into gray wig. I was also carrying a bag which sat between us the whole ride. We were shoulder to shoulder, and shared many glances to the point where I began to giggle bc we said nothing... Just a few moments of eye contact. You were tall about 5'11-6'3, Latino (or mixed), wearing a black leather jacket. We lost each other once all three of us (you and your friend, and I) got off on 42nd and walked up the stairs, passed the shuttle train tracks. But I was meeting a friend and had to leave the station. I gave you one more look back, but you were assisting your friend. I'm sure you won't see this, but If you do I'd like to get to know you. It was clear you were upset that night but I hope the rest of your evening got better. And please describe what I was wearing in your response...

I'm posting here rather than reaching out directly because I don't want things to be awkward. We've got so many mutual friends. We're both single. I thought (especially that first night we met) that there was a very palpable attraction. Most of the males in our clique concur. You like my humor; I enjoy yours. You're attractive. You're thoughtful. You're introspective and considerate. And you've recognized that I'm all of these things, too. So, what makes you ""just not into it,"" when you're into nearly every other half-employed option that passes by? It's confusing.I'm not interested in belaboring a point of preference. I respect it. I just wish I understood. At your party, I heard your friends saying ""That's V? He's cute!"" in the encouraging way friends say these sort of things. Like there's something about me you're averse to. But aren't we adults? Can't we be childishly, simplisticly, attracted? I'm not interested in politely reaching into the darkness to feel your disinterest. I'm interested in the girl who came across a crowded room to be alone with me last March. I'm interested in being the guy who liked you enough that he didn't fuck you in the basement the night he met you. Instead, I showed you that I was interested. I still smile thinking about how I caught you, falling through the trees in your skis. It was effortless for me. So, Rosie the Riveter... Be as strong as you look? We can do it. Since it's the 5th of November, Remember. Remember. That words can change the world. That behind the mask is not a man, but an idea. And that ideas are bulletproof. All that's left for me to wonder about now is how compatible we might really be. So this is my experiment:I've never mentioned that I troll missed connections before. But I do. Do you?

If you are - then literally wtf dude?First of all - the staring? Chill your eyeballs bro. I felt those things boring a hole in my cranium before I even noticed you. I get it, ya know? I was looking good yesterday. I snoozed through 8 alarms and stumbled out of bed 45 minutes late. I haphazardly slammed some makeup across my face and threw my dirty hair into a bun. I overdressed because I just moved back from California and I really don't understand the weather here anymore. Later in the day I got caught in a substantial downpour that ignited my frizz filled Jew fro and turned my bangs into much shorter, curlier bangs than I'd ever imagined was possible. Pair all of that with a little late 20's PMS induced acne and the general wear and tear of a long day and damn. I get it. I was looking fly as fuck dude. So I first noticed you when your dumb eyes were laser cutting into my face. I'm like 70% of the way through Into Thin Air so shit's getting good. I'm surprised anything tore me away from that book but it's difficult to ignore someone trying to move things with their brain à la Matilda or whatever you were doing. I caught your eyes and immediately felt something. It was mostly fear of impending doom because you were FIXATED but also you're not bad looking. Whatever. I'm lonely. I noticed that for some reason you had strapped your backpack across your chest like an overanxious high school freshman OR like Jon Krakauer in the best selling non-fiction book I mentioned was sitting in my lap. Suuuuuup fate?But you ruined it. Listen, I'm 28 years old and spend arguably too much time on my cell phone like most of my generation. This experience means that I am skilled in both taking a stealth picture (flash must be off, noise silenced, body slightly reclined so it doesn't seem like your phone's at a weird angle) and recognizing when someone is taking one of me. I appreciate your ingenuity and technique for sure: you rotated your phone and took multiple pictures in succession. To the untrained eye it maybe looked like you were wiping the screen or learning to juggle in a very inefficient way, but not me babe. I know you took a picture and I am NOT happy about it. Seriously? What part of my sweat soaked, rain drenched, frizz banged, and makeup-less appearance got you going? What did you need to commemorate so badly? It was creepy and weird (and sure I've done it like once) but you made me feel really uncomfortable after a long day. Not cool. But also you have really nice brown eyes and I've been single for a while. Tell me what random organizing thing you were lugging around and maybe we can get together and take pictures together or something.","","",2015-11-09 03:00:15.797158,2015-11-09 03:00:15.797158,detail page

Instead, I would have grabbed you by the lapels and matched my lips to yours that evening we explored Little Italy for, what felt like, the first time. . . or finally worked up the courage to confess my growing emotions that night we watched one of our favorite shows on your fire escape months ago under that summer moon. The other evening, you had asked me if I'd ever truly been in love. ""Yes, just once, I suppose"". . . .But, that wasn't an entirely honest response. I asked the same question of you. ""No, I don't think I really ever have"". You mentioned the difficulty distinguishing between love and familiarity. I told you my philosophy on soulmates. Love's a funny thing, though. . . I've always chalked it up to lust and comfort and familiarity. But, you have to admit, there's something far more mystical about it. . . I recall a very early morning in late June. We were on the J train. . . You know that long haul between Marcy and Essex. . . You and I were traveling home after a long night of filming in Brooklyn and I pointed out the breathtaking view of the city. We took a break from our banter to take in the sights. You thoughtfully took everything in. . . Wandering in between train car windows to catch every possible angle. Anyway, there are a few things I never told you about that day. . . The evening prior, on my way to that very shoot, I rode the same train and admired the same beautiful surroundings. The moment was picturesque. But, I remember thinking ""I really wish I could share this with someone. . ."" Someone who would genuinely understand the loveliness that was surrounding me at that exact minute. That exact second. I felt so very fortunate to be able to share that moment with you. And, to be honest, watching you find the beauty in the exact same sights I had only hours earlier, warmed my heart. And, another thing: In that 4 minute journey into Manhattan, as we watched the cars and buildings sail passed us, the same excitement a small child feels on Christmas morning overtook me. I knew in that exact moment that I could love you. We were mere Subway Buddies then. In the time since, you've become my partner in crime. My rock/paper/scissors. I joke about the first time we met. . .. You rolled your eyes at my lame attempt at a joke (though I know you'll claim you never did such a thing!) and I thought to myself ""there's no way this kid and I are going to get along!"". Turns out, I couldn't have been more wrong. . . We ended up with a relationship far more dear to my heart than I'd ever imagined. The last thing I aim to do is scare you off with my overly flowery words. . . You know how us writers can be! I just wanted to let you know how very special you are to me, my dear. I've attached no ultimatums or pressure to this letter; only my most honest of thoughts and feelings. XOXOXO ​​​​​​​​​Yours truly, ​​​​​​​​​Ms. Evelyn Drinker","","",2015-11-09 03:00:35.690191,2015-11-09 03:00:35.690191,detail page

1485,5301927734,So today... - w4m,2015-11-05 14:24,/mnh/mis/5301927734.html,mnh,w4m,New York,"Just now. Im here trying on shoes at the store. I walk over to the mirror, leaving my worn shoes over at the seat, along with my shopping cart with my personal belongings. As Im looking in the mirror, I see this elderly lady-morena kicks my sneakers over to plop right down on my spot. As she sits, she has her foot rest on my sneaker. Usually, I wouldnt say anything but take my things and move over to the next available seat. But I couldnt even do that, being that she so effortlessly had her foot resting on my freaking sneaker. OK. So I go over and tell her ""Miss, you're sitting in my seat"" She looks at me and goes off. I tell her, ""Miss, you can have the seat, for thats not the issue here. The issue here is, I seen what you just did-you kicked my shoe and now youre..."" The old lady, didnt even allow me to finish my sentence w/out her making me look like the worst kind of individual for arguing with an old lady over a seat. Thats the part, that igged me. Instead of just acknowledging/apologizing, no she'd rather argue, play the old lady card like a loud-speaker;despite my telling her directly the issue. Ofcourse I wouldve let it go from jump, but the fact she can muster all the energy in the world to not allow me a word in edgewise, to argue me down b/c gues what-I can speak English; was the reason I had to call her on it. When she seen I wouldnt let the issue go until she'd apologize, she got up but not without calling me all types of names under her breath, my favorite-""jackass"".This is where I responded with ""Yeah youre lucky, you're 100 yrs old..."" Her grandson or son (?) jumps in and says ""Or you do what?"" Then we go at it. I point out, if the tables were turned and if I wouldve kicked her shoes to the side, to sit down I wouldve received the only curse-out; no questions asked. And yes, I did bring the race card. Threw in their face, that the reason that ""they think they can get away with it with us, is b/c we're Hispanics"". Then he pulls out ""Do you have your diploma, you sound real uneducated""So wait a minute. I'm ""uneducated"" for pointing out the obvious. For finally speaking up for myself. Cause this type of treatment has been going on for the ages. We, always kept our mouths shut. Let it roll of our backs. Why? B/c at the end of the day, its not worth getting into it with 'savages'. So now, when someone defends themselves, we're labeled as ""uneducated"".OK.I have a friend/Spanish whose no more than five feet tall, if that!! Tell me why, she was constantly bullied in front of her kids then finally jumped so bad in front of her kids; that she suffers from health complications as a result. Had to move elsewhere. And guess who jumped her?I had another friend, that while she was walking with her nieces and nephews and her kids was jumped with all of them, at her side. She moved elsewhere. Same flipping problem. Being bullied relentlessly. Guess what she is? Guess who her bully is?My prior apartment dwelling. Bullied, taunted, humiliated on a constant for yrs by a grown woman with grandkids. Effing twice my age. Always showed her a's in front of my child, where I wouldnt budge cause as a mother, I'd rather look like the punk than for anything happen to us. Yet when it was only me and her and I approached her. Nothing. Not a peep. But as soon as I was with my child, she took advantage.And you threw how our worst fault is how we dont speak English. OK.Well maybe perhaps, some of us dont speak English. But what about the majority of those, who do match your skin color who speak the English very well. Well enough, to curse and call eachother ""Nigger"" and communicate via ebonics/street slang. Yeah those whose life purpose-despite growing up here, where we are rich in resources for getting ahead, college-wise and so forth-instead inspire to grow up to become high school drop outs, have kids out of wedlock from like ten different baby-daddys and run game on the welfare system? Yet theyre the same ones, screaming and hollering about police brutality. Theyre the same ones, cursing us out and quick to call us ""illegals"" The same ones, to pin us with African ancestry but in denial due to embarrassment-type-crap. The same ones, that are society throw-up; meaning drug dealing, keep the streets dirty and who dont know how to clean after themselves-no class, no education, nothing civilized about them whatsoever. And yeah-Im saying it.They're like, what is it that you called me many moons ago when you were out, smelling yourself...oh yeah ""Gutter Trash"".No more moreno-loving days for me. No mas. Im done. People arent born, hating. Its created. Now I understand many, many things thru the eyes of many, thru their description.And yeah, we may not speak English. The majority, they get married first, have kids working household and instill in their children to become productive model citizens in society. And if we do wrong, we're quick to point our faults. We dont sweep them under the rug and blame society for our hindrance. We do what we have to do. We're 'hungry' too. But we dont kill our own people via drug selling, leave our ""baby-moms"" to fend for themselves, nor treat any other races w/such effing disrespect. So you want to preach to me, police brutality...gee boy genius, is there any wonder the driving culprit? Here's a hint: Its not racism. And tho some police officers are rotten, but the other side of the story, carries responsibility as well.And then its not even you, not even you whose been writing me. Not even you. Oh and before I forget-you were quick to throw how my race is the worst, yet when we were dating-you never ceased to remind me how I was the very best you ever had. Now we're all the worst, all cause why....cause you married a morena. Really?! #FOHNever ceases to amaze me no matter how college/ivy-leagued educated an individual may have, they're like the worst in their ignorance. Youre preaching police brutality. Do you know just how simpleton of a joke, you sound. Like that vast amount of knowledge you racked up, and yet, still dont know how to use/think outside of the circle to think, for 'yourself'.Ninkumpoot.Not so long ago, I went to a job interview. Good job, w/the government too. The supervisor and I, hit it off immediately. I remember, leaving my jacket in a room where with whom I was introduced to, well I left my jacket there, while the supervisor gave a tour of the plant. Tell me why, when I was at the turnstyle with my jacket in tow, I had been left with empty pockets. Meaning-my metro card was stolen. Like really? Youre going to steal a lady's metro card??? And I know it wasnt stolen out of needs. It was straight malice. I declined the company's offer. Wasnt worth swimming in such sea of malice. Never bothered saying anything. But now, I'm going to email the supervisor to report 'em. B/c Im female and Hispanic. Youre going to dig into my pockets and have the nerve to steal a measling metro card, to screw my day over. Like thank goodness, I brought my purse with me.Le fuq am I doing, still on this site then. This craziness, you persist in having me entangled, does not pertain to me.Now more than ever, I know what I have to do.Its just the more I experience this crap, the more I see how flipping ruthless and disgusting your kind truly are. You all, would back stab me/our kind in a heartbeat. No regards no nothing. Savages.I swear to God Stan, Fuck you.I would say all of this directly, but alas due to limited open communication-yeah yeah we know. With that said, if you ever, ever once in your life ever EVER held an ounce of any ""love"" thats geniune, Im telling you, to please do not bother looking for me in the real world. Leave me be. I geniunely do not want anything to do with you. Ever. Dont bother looking for me. Nor bother to show face.To my sister-Word to the Wise-if you think they won't betray you, you are deadly mistaken. Other than that, when was the last time you spoke to Papi>? Lets pray, that you'd never ever end up on your death bed, puking up your lungs, liver bile; begging for air, but taking off that oxygen mask, so youd be able to die quicker b/c the pain of it all, is just too great. And just pray, that someone for whom you sacrificied so much for, never swears on your grave.Fuck you.","","",2015-11-09 03:00:38.864544,2015-11-09 03:00:38.864544,detail page

There was an express train across the platform and I expected it to be the end.Somehow I looked up and you were still there, walking to go upstairs maybe? All I know is that you looked at me...I don't think I've ever done anything in my life good enough to deserve such a look. You didn't exactly have a smile, but even just eye contact with a girl that pretty can make a man's week.Thanks for that. Sometimes these things happen to you in life just when you need them to.","","",2015-11-09 03:01:07.182882,2015-11-09 03:01:07.182882,detail page

You're going to email me about 'corrupt cops' against morenos and critique every other race but your own? Seriously??!?! Seriously, well that explains why you still have asswipe still on your FB friendlist then.I gotta add before anything, this is the reason why right here as Im sure my hermanos y hermanas are feeling it as well. But this is why, we have to stop bigging up these African American tv shows; showing them support and showering with media credit, when we post on social media. We so have to stop that altogether. Because 1- You never ever see not one African American bigging up any Hispanic in any way or form, in anything. 2- They're ALWAYS the first ones to bad-mouth our hispanic 'idol' celebrities, knock us to 'trump' over their matching skin celebrities. 3- We just need to start and stay representing our shows/etc; like we're never in the main stream in terms of tv shows/etc and why, b/c we hide behind these black shows giving them props on media outlet but wonder why, we can still count on one hand on how many Hispanic celebrities there are and why we are practically non-existent and why, society still refers to us as the cooty-illed illegals bringing this country down. When in reality, we are more than just ""toilet-cleaners"". And we are. Its just time, we owned our titulo. As for you, well thanks for allowing this vent. Thats one good thing that came out of this whole cl saga. That asswipe, you still have on your friendlist. That screams volumes. What he did. Lets put it this way, if the tables were turned I so wouldve deleted him off my fb-friendlist. Its not even about the romantic attachment between us. We couldve been purely platonic. But its just knowing your character, your struggles and the angle from where this asswipe was throwing his jabs ESPECIALLY knowing *his history* (like seriously, you gots nerve to talk??!)-I for one, would not had kept him on my friend list. You keeping him there, speaks volume. And I shouldnt have to tell you, or pitch a fit, that shouldve came from you. Not from me, telling you.Then again, what more can one expect who listened to a boricua, who told you I wasnt good for you. And you listened, no questions asked. Oh and your moms and sis. You mentioned how they were against us being serious back then, yet...yet-YET...I'm good enough now?! Gee. I wonder how that happened?!And see, unlike you and your people I do understand to a certain extent where your fam was coming from at that time. I do. Altho doesnt make it any right, nor pacifies the here-and-now tho.Its just YO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!All of this that we find ourselves in-You and I-when it comes down to us...couldve been so avoided if you'd just pulled up your man-pants and communicated with me in the real world. Instead, Im here alone on my end of my computer screen; venting what time left me with all due to your refusal to give me face. Now aint that a bitch!Its not even about the race thingy. Its about what I'd have to put up with, in the aftermath of all this. Red flags, never ceases to remind me that at the end of all this, I am only fooling myself when it comes to a happily ever after when it comes to us.Now that I myself, is coming out of that ignorance pool, I'm taking in how experience is the only motherfucker when it comes to teaching one, truth. To bypass what life's lessons in strength of 'love'...my gosh, what did I ever learn in the first place in doing so.You point out police brutality-me, for once I'd like to see for once, one black person doing the bitchin' point out what their race need to rectify in order to evolve as a whole. Yet as fast as they are at spitting on us, theyre the same ones to jab us with we're Africans then lynch us w/we're prejudice but in all, what they/and now you, fail to realize is, look at the source.Personally, its been day in and day out w/what Im fed about. I had an African American friend, who warned me about this eons ago, to which I really took as exaggeration. But now, nowhere nears of sorts. From my past relationship, I remember going thru it with my 'mother in law', who nitpicked my physique, who one day I so had to put her in her place by pointing out her daughter's well-rounded figure. Again, goes back to my rant earlier. Its like how much more can a person take with this crap. To only solidify this 'crap' indefinitely, by allowing your life to become mine?!!No. Can. Do.Let me clarify-theres bad apples in every race. Mine too. But its gotten to the point of no return-to say the least. Its like enough already.And if this is what I'm ""experiencing"" now-alone. And if your fam/friends are a certain way-alone. Taking into consideration, my other gripes, how you never listen. You never listen to me but to everyone else. What happens when we have problems in our relationship? You'll do, what you always do, run to one of your hen-friends who happens to be black who looks at me side-ways, for advice. Really? Leaving me, with no-sayso. As usual.Gotta ask myself. Do I really want to spend the rest of my 'pretty years' spent, w/a muzzle?! My so-called other half never takes into account, what I have to say, my wants and my needs cause Im not black enough or perhaps I dont know how it is to be black or simply Im not black, period. Thats just a gist. So you'll go to this hen friend, who happens to be black for advice b/c its how you roll. You go to everyone else, but the source, me.Why do I feel this...why? Cause its the only actions youve given me, time and time again. Back then, I was a spick. Not worthy of you, for such and such reasons and instead of listening to your heart, you listened. You listened to someone who had no geniune intentions towards you. Who succeeded in jypping you, out of me. Yeah-thats one. And for a great while thereafter-I remember, I wasnt good enough cause, well cause I was a 'spick'. You cock-blocked me at every turn whenever I attempted to win you back, cause well, I was a spick who wasnt good enough. Left me, for someone who matched your skin color. Still played that unfiltered fool for you, yet you still wouldnt budge, cause why???Yeah. I remember.And yet still, instead of just coming back to communicate directly like any sane person. You wouldnt speak to me in reality but stayed posting here. I said, I didnt want to do cl any more, you kept me here for ...whats that, think its going on to siete jodio anos.Whenever I called to get to the bottom of this, mayhem you hung up on me. Then laughed about it among your many posts here. You stalk me, when I went to the police I was the one arrested. You laughted about it. My mother died, yep you laughed about it and effed with my head ten times more. You told me, at my lowest to commit suicide. Then chase that comment with lovey dovey posts, filled with sentiments of sweet dreaming and far-fetched love.You laughed and made a mockery, at my pain. Aside from this mind-fucking cl world, you were trying to suck me in. In my world, where were you??? Where were you, when the stacks were down, where were you, when I needed you? Where were you, when the world was against me and I had to fend for myself...where were you??? Oh how I tended to forget-I'm a 'spick'. So you never bothered to look at me twice. Where were you? Oh busy sticking it in the morenas and white girls. Oh but I should feel special then, cause by the looks of it, I was the only Latina you ever looked at, huh?!!! As Im sure, if I never came to the picture, youd be married to a white girl. After going thru what Im going thru, cant say I blame you. Sad to say, but true.And even if,,,,even if the fairy tales youve written were ever true, I would always have to live my life second-guessing your actions. Who the eff, wants to live life like that???You never listen. You never take my words, with respect and value. And its not as if, Im swimming in success as Im sure theres always lessons to be learnt, such as life and still consider myself, a work in progress but if Im here, I arrived here on my own...alone.You never bothered to pick a phone. Not even snail-mailed me. You laughed and labeled me as delusional when I tried to contact you. Like what excuse in the world, do you have to rectify these actions?? I wasnt good enough for you then, so you know what, Im not good enough for you now either. You never even tried. Not one time. Not one. You listened to everyone else. You allowed everyone else decide the affairs to your heart.And tho despite me telling you directly, that the only thing you ever had to do was just come back. Fucking simple. Just come back home. You never did and you still wont. Something so simple. All I asked was for something tangible. Something real. And youve given, not one.So time is egging me w/""WTF are you still holding on to???""And I cant find not one reason to, not anymore.~Thank you for that.","","",2015-11-09 03:01:09.963929,2015-11-09 03:01:09.963929,detail page

1564,5300795612,Brunette in Central Park near 72nd Street - m4w,2015-11-04 19:03,/mnh/mis/5300795612.html,mnh,m4w,Upper West Side,"I was walking through Central Park this afternoon when I took a detour toward the west side. I was at the statue of the Falconer near the 72nd Street entrance when I sat down for a few minutes. I had on jeans and a dark green shirt, and I was carrying a brown leather jacket (it was warm today, even for this time of year.) I dropped my newspaper, the pages blew everywhere, and you ran over to help. You had dark brown, wavy hair, and a black coat. You were wearing a green skirt, or maybe a dress - your coat was buttoned, so I don't know which. In the moment, that's all I saw. I was too concerned, I suppose, with making sure I didn't lose my newspaper to the horses. It's not often that I spring for a copy of the New York Times. The breeze was strong, and the pages were blowing everywhere. But looking back on that brief interaction, there was more. I already had Real Estate and Dining & Wine tucked under my arm, and I didn't notice at the time how you laughed when we both reached for Weather; it was the same way you used to laugh on the playground. You could run faster than all of the boys - even me, and I used to tell everyone (like an idiot) that I could run faster than the wind itself. When you handed me the pages you'd picked up I didn't really pay any attention to your fingernails, but now that I think about it you used to bite them as a child, too. Nervous habit, I guess.I'll know you when I see you, I've always thought. I know I will. I have known it for twenty-seven years and that's how long I have been looking. It was the only thing I knew for certain other than the fact that I hadn't seen you yet, or if I had then I hadn't seen you fully.But really that's only a half-truth. I did see you once when we were younger. Well, technically I saw you almost every day, but there was one day in particular when I saw you: a single glance across a classroom, and you were looking back at me with eyes that were quicker than mine, smarter than mine. I knew you, then, but it was just a glimpse, and I thought I couldn't trust it. I didn't know I could trust it; we were only kids, after all. I looked away, and I've never been sorrier for any mistake I've made thus far in my life.Your eyes today - I don't know how I didn't recognize you in them.When you and I disappeared from each others' lives so many years ago, I didn't think of you at first. I'm sorry to say that most days I didn't think of you at all. Ashamed, if I'm being honest. But after a time - I can't say for sure how long - I started thinking of you most days. And then I started looking.I looked for you around corners. The corners of buildings, I mean, because I was still a boy too afraid that you would see me first. Now I'm older and smarter than I was, and I've learned to look for you around the corners of my mind while I walk north on MacDougal Street. I always throw quarters to the folk singers and shoot the shit with the old timers at the chess tables, and I always stop to talk with Dierdre who lives on Amsterdam Avenue but has sold hats on West 12th Street since 1974. (I wonder if Dierdre is her real name.) I never walk up Sixth Avenue because I prefer the closeness of Fifth and on the periphery of it all I always, I always, I always look for you.The ages have passed while I've walked these streets. I've seen thousands of faces, millions perhaps, but none of them were yours. I'll know you when I see you - I was sure of it. I convinced myself that I wouldn't even mind if you didn't know me right away. But I thought you would. I hoped.The park is for tourists, and families, and lovers, and secrets, and me.I don't always visit the Falconer. It was more of a coincidence that I turned in that direction at all. Most days I'll wait for you at Bethesda Fountain, but when I'm feeling masochistic I'll turn up at Rat Rock. When I can't take it anymore I'll stop looking altogether and walk through The Ramble until I get lost. (I can't get lost; I know those paths.) But it was the Falconer today, because during these autumn afternoons I like how the statue nearly escapes everyone's notice. I sat to his right, my jacket beneath me to dull the cold ground. I opened the newspaper I'd brought with me; since I hadn't seen you yet, I had to fill my time somehow.I'll never admit it, but I'm good at the crosswords.Sometimes I've wondered how often we've passed by each other looking in opposite directions; or stood on opposite ends of the same subway car; or sat at distant tables in the same bar, both of us drinking whatever's on tap; or; or; or. Sometimes I feared you didn't even live here anymore, that I'd wasted all these years for nothing. I looked into each face - I don't know you, I don't know you. I can't stay if you're not here, but I won't leave in case you are.I sat there on the grass, waiting, because that's mostly what I have done these many years - even while doing other things, really I'm always waiting to run into you again. At times I've wondered if there's something wrong with me, to spend half my life looking for someone who might be looking for someone else. Anyway, I must have been distracted by the leaves raining down, so when the wind picked up I lost my grip on the newspaper. The sections came apart mid-fall and landed scattered across the walking path below my overlook. Some people were startled - they really don't notice The Falconer up here, out of the way - and I jumped up to collect the pages before they blew into the street and I lost them to the horses and - oh, you know the rest.I saw you, but I didn't know you. I guess it's my fault; I wasn't paying attention. I guess you weren't either. So maybe we're both to blame. You know, sometimes I wonder if you're even looking. Hell, I'd stay in one place if I knew you were.","","",2015-11-09 03:01:17.665787,2015-11-09 03:01:17.665787,detail page

We both know that life sometimes throws us in different directions. Yours is currently in New York, mine, in a crummy place somewhere else, but we both have responsibilities. People have expectations of us that puts us in different places.I have this month and next month to get through, and then I can feel free to say 'fuck this shit, I'm going somewhere else now' and you have work as well, work and whatever else you can find to brighten your days. I have to admit that I miss loving my job the way you love yours, but then again, your job gives you so much and mine does nothing but drain my soul from me.I've started work on a new piece - it is emotionally draining - and have an idea kicking around for another one - which actually sounds like it is going to be fun (I heard the funniest story about a waiter - it needs to be written!) and I've heard that you honestly look like you are enjoying your latest conquest (and we both know it WILL be a conquest).Soon, I hope. Soon we will be able to sit down and talk, face to face. Then again, it is hope, and hope is truly a useless and dangerous emotion. I learned that a long time ago.So here is your ad, your wish for a kiss goodbye in the morning, and your desire for that normality that we both lack. Have a good day at work today, don't forget your lunch (brown paper bag, yummie!) and above all, love what you do, more than you love anything (or anyone) else. Be true to yourself, and remember, I will do everything I can to not lie to you - even when everyone else around me is lying to you.what news am I going to get from you today?Guess who?",40.737500,-73.981300,2015-11-09 03:01:32.888515,2015-11-09 03:01:32.888515,detail page

Why bother being Involved with someone or saying I love you when it's not true. Why claim to be faithful when your not. It's just selfish and people like that ruin it for all the people with love in their heart. I really don't feel good right now. I ate this chicken roll from this place on union turnpike and I'm so grossed out right now. I almost bought a bottle of coke that had already been opened and she said they cant monitor things like that. Why is it everything that tastes good is bad for you? I am starting to think it only tastes good because its some mental shit and we as human beings are attracted to bad things. My longest and most passion filled love affair was with heroin. It's a miracle I am alive. I try to be kind to people because God saved my life on several occasions. I'm really confused about life and the unfairness of the world really confuses me beyond anything reasonable.

You told me you were a born and raised New Yorker of Mexican/Honduran descent, newly wed, living and working in Manhattan. Something drew me to direct message you though we had never met. You said your name was Maria. You would later tell me that you had never had any desire to converse with someone you didn't know, but that I had been just charismatic enough (you'd insert a winking emoticon here), to piqued your interest. We spoke late into that night, the following night, and the night after that.We quickly grew close. Every additional conversation was a new discovery in how amazingly well we meshed together. We both had never meet another person that we instantly felt like we had known forever. You loved Aaliyah, the Yankees, and chamomile tea. You loved reading and told me you would be surrounded with Orchids at all times if it were possible. You teased me about being a silly country boy who was much too proud of the bad Spanish he picked up during Peace Corps service and found my love of 90's New York hip hop amusing for someone that had grown up on a road named after a part of a farm animal's anatomy. I teased you about your obsession with the discontinued Johnson's Body Care - Melt Away Stress Lavender & Chamomile Body Wash and the tattoo you got on your right hip at twenty that read ""fire and ice"" in Chinese characters. When you revealed to me shortly thereafter you several months pregnant, I felt like I somehow already knew.You had gotten married to your on again/off again boyfriend you had known for several years. You had found out he was cheating, separated, gotten back together, discovered you were pregnant, and agreed to marry. You had hope it would led to better things. It had not. You said he showed less interest in being a husband or a father seemingly by the day. I learned most nights would find you sleeping on small couch after some fight or argument as he slumbered in the apartment's queen-size bed. You had decided shortly before we met you would move out as soon after you had the baby. You had miscarried before and were scared. Your mother, who I would come to learn had been your absolute everything, had passed recently and unexpectedly from a stroke at 52. It was very hard for you to speak about your father.We had agreed early on to keep our correspondence quiet. You were worried it it might negatively affect any divorce settlement agreement and needed every penny possible to move out. You wanted to take these next steps on your own with no help from anyone. Whenever I attempted to offer any money or assistance, you would tell me you only need my time, love, and patience. I named the little girl in your growing belly ""Melon,"" because you constantly craved melon as she grew bigger and bigger. You jokingly insisted her middle name was going to be Melon until I wasn't sure if you were joking anymore. You were excited to be a mother. You begin talking about finding a job in Atlanta and bringing yourself and little Melon down south to start over. We'd giggle over the idea of orchid-filled weddings and that beautiful shiny antique vintage wedding ring you had saw an elderly woman wearing on the L one day. I had never felt more excited or hopeful about the future. We were in love.Melon came too early and didn't survive. You moved in with your older sister in the Bronx. We mourned together. You struggled. I fought with you to see a professional to help you work through things. You had gone earlier in life and disliked the process immensely. I worried about more and more about you, both with issues I have mentioned here and others I have not. The dark days became increasingly frequent and were beginning to be the norm and not the exception. In your most soberest moment, you revealed you wish you could go to sleep and not wake up. This terrified me. I felt you slipping away.The last I heard from you was September 22nd (or possibly the 25th) of 2013. You sent me and email reading: ""Sorry. I'll talk to you soon. I'm alright."" Days turned into weeks and I began to worry. Weeks turned months and I feared the worst. I continue to do everything I can to find you. Last year through a miracle I still don't quite understand, I was able to somehow locate your sister's apartment in the Bronx. Within a few days, I had flown to the New York for the first time and found myself on the stoop in front of your sister's building on Rochambeau Avenue in the Bronx. Several people in the building including your neighbors recognized you, but didn't know you or your sister beyond an occasional hello. The apartment had been vacated some months before. The building management had no additional info. I spent the next several days in New York tracking down any and every lead I could, but ultimately came up with only dead ends.Maria, I hope you're out there. I hope you're reading this. If not, I hope to hear from someone that knows you. If Maria's sister is reading this: Im sorry we never didnt know each other. Your sister and I loved each other very much. Please understand that anything is preferable to the pain of not knowing what happened to someone you cared about so deeply. Maria is 5'4"" or 5'5"".

Maria has a very close friend in Connecticut that she visited regularly. The friend was married, has three boys, and may have been expecting a fourth at some point. Maria said when they were together, people thought they were sisters and was always excited to spend time with her. One of my favorite emails from you reads: ""Woke up feeling, happy. In love.

1637,5299322507,"Hey James Bond, Snapchat Girl here... - w4m",2015-11-03 20:58,/mnh/mis/5299322507.html,mnh,w4m,East Village,"Dear Supremely Attractive Man Dressed As James Bond,It was Saturday night, the height of Halloween celebrations. I was the girl dressed as a Snapchat filter. I had super rouged cheeks, a rainbow painted on my chin, was wearing a black leather dress/jacket/booties, and was constantly unhinging my jaw to imitate a video filter. You were tall, dark, and handsome, wearing a suit or tuxedo that led me to believe that you were dressed as a dapper British spy for the evening. I think our alter-egos speak volumes. James Bond is definitely a Snapchat kinda guy. I appreciate a man who's packing heat.Allow me to explain: after Friday night's All Hallow's Eve shenanigans, I was exhausted and incapable of putting on pants, getting off of the couch, and concocting one of the many excellent ideas I had for another costume (Tinderella? Chris Christie? Captain Underpants?). After rummaging through my closet and almost pulling a Lizzie McGuire-esque outfit repeat, I turned to my most beloved and frequently used app, Snapchat; it's an app for which I am known for notoriously over-abusing - a notion that I personally deem impossible. I did not have a costume, but I did have a crate of crafting supplies from my sorority girl days... and so I showered, put on a short leather dress, blowdried my hair, and painted my chin into a stream of rainbow vomit, complete with sparkles. And yes, I used straight-up acrylic paint. On my face.I'm going to blame the paint that I accidentally ingested that night for what occurred between us. As my friends and I moved from our pre-game on 2nd Ave to our first destination of the night on Ave B, somewhere along East 4th Street, you and your friends walked towards us. My Evolution of Taylor Swift squad followed me, and your group laughed as they recognized my efforts. ""Hey, she's Snapchat! That's so funny!"" Then you, objectively one of the most attractive men in New York, took the time to physically stop me on the street and compliment my costume as a conversation starter.""Hey, I really like this! Great idea!"" you said, touching my arm.My response?In a split second, I widened my eyes and opened my mouth in a crude imitation of the actual filter, and the most questionable noise erupted from my windpipe. I ""meeeeeehr""ed at you and proceeded to walk away quickly in shock while my girl gang followed with peals of laughter. And for that, I am so sorry. This is why I am decidedly single. I wasn't even drunk yet.I regretted making that face/sound/life decision immediately afterwards and for the remainder of the night. I'm doubtful that you'll ever see this, but if by some chance you do, I promise that I'm not that weird - you were just that cute. I can provide references to vouch for my sanity. My roommate will inform you that I can cook gourmet meals and that my karaoke game is strong. My co-workers demand my baked goods on a regular basis. My brother insists that I am indeed the best sister ever, particularly when I'm doing his homework. My parents are very proud that I've never been to jail and have yet to bear their grandchildren.So, 007, if you're out there - holler at me. I won't actually puke rainbows on you. This time, I'll choose the heart-eyes emoji filter.With hope,Snapchat Puking Rainbows Filter Girl Who Is Actually Pretty Cool",40.726188,-73.989429,2015-11-09 03:01:50.113958,2015-11-09 03:01:50.113958,detail page

I know that you do not lie, so I know that has not changed.I think you thought that I was too good and you were not worthy of me. I thought I was perhaps too old or perhaps not rich enough or good looking enough. I saw that you were trapped and that most of you was not here. I saw the quiet desperation of the look in your eyes from the first moment that I met you. I have always been looking for you that was the whole point of my existence. The job was merely the means to find you. I never cared about anything else, wealth fame these things were meaningless to me. It was the quest of finding true love and creating internal perfection of character. Your very presence drove me to be a better man as it did in other lifetimes. You do not understand how cherished you are in the eyes of God, you hatred of yourself was simply a reflection of your goodness of living in a profane world. What you have done matters not to me, that does not change your nature. You have already proven yourself to me a long long time ago. I will wait to the bitter end, there is no where else to go. I made feeble attempts to look in other places, but after having met you it is pointless.I know that you are afraid to hurt me, you probably don't contact me for that reason. I have learned much over these last few years since we have been apart. I drove you out intentionally, that was necessary.

I hope someone who has instagram will see this and forward this post to you, so you know the kind of guy he really is. PLEASE confront him and ask him why he has been cheating on you this entire time.. Because I'm pretty sure you guys don't have an open relationship.. You deserve a better guy. I'm so sorry you had to find out like this, but you deserve to know the truth.","","",2015-11-09 03:02:20.087223,2015-11-09 03:02:20.087223,detail page

I am about 5'11"" tall, average build and work in a law firm in Manhattan.I know people have told me not to put too much detail into this post, but I want to begin by being HONEST about my circumstances, what I am looking for, and HOPEFULLY someone out there will have either been in a similar situation, or at least be able to empathize to the point of (I hope) a cup of coffee, at least.First of all about AGE? Doesnt matter.. all my life was in relationships with my age.. yet last gf was 21 and I am late 50s. We were together as a couple for 3 years. She was tired of guys her age who only wanted her for the physical, then left her. She wanted someone more Mature who would truly take time to get to know her as a person. Someone Older who would listen to her thoughts, feelings, respect, care for her.And romantically, someone more Mature who would take time for warmth, affection, Tenderness. Someone who would go slow---hold hands, cuddle, be gentle.That is why it worked.. and why it PROVES when it comes to age it is truly just a number. For feelings are Universal at any age.So if you are in my age range, fine. But if younger, doesnt matter!Either way!OK so that being said, here goes (LOL):Some time ago I lost many things at once:1) Girlfriend of 7 years (she broke up);2) Best male friends of 20 years (they did not die but went their own way)3) My car4) My job (D0NT WORRY I have a good job now)5) And my own place (share for now --divorced for 10 years now, can prove it and saving to get OWN place again in 4 months).Subsequent to all those losses, I did make 1 true friend (platonic) and was in a relationship with a woman for 1-1/2 years, which ended a few months ago (she moved out of NY).At this point, I am seeking a friend to talk to, to do things with.I AM SO TIRED of doing everything ALONE.. it HURTS!Id like to meet a pleasant, warm female companion to share things with.. movies, walks, anything we have in common.I enjoy bowling, outdoors, LOVE nature.. fresh air, trees, and music.Love All kinds of music pretty much.. books, moviesBut most especially just being with a special person.It is NOT easy to be ALONE in NY. And despite the fact I have recovered pretty much from what I pointed out in the 5 points above, being alone again now. Just feels empty.. especially around the holidays!I put this ad in BOTH the platonic section AND the dating section because I am OPEN to both friendship AND romance.I happen to be a very Affectionate person, love to hug, cuddle? I love it.Ultimately, I am looking for a woman I can CHERISH, treasure for her mind, heart and soul? a woman who wants a man who will be LOYAL, TRUSTING, who will stand by her no matter what.. who will be her best friend, her soulmate.A man who she can turn to at all times.. to lean on for strength, emotional support. Who will be tender, gentle, and loving.If ure looking for that too.. not a man who plays games but a man who can be DEVOTED, WARM, loving, a good listener.. empathic.. im here!I am college educated, and fix computers on the side.. so if u need any help with your computer, feel free to ask.OK that's about it. IF you are looking for an older man or a man your age that you can talk to, lean on, who will listen to your feelings or just have fun with, please write me.All I ask is that if you are interested, to meet for coffee and talk.. that?s all I ask. IN PUBLIC of course so u feel SAFE.. and play it all by ear from there.I am trying very much to get my own place in COUPLE of months.. still paying for co op where I live with ex wife.. have own room she dates I date. its just financial.But I want to sell the coop soon this year.. its probably worth almost $250,000.. even when I split proceeds with ex wife (which I have to do by law- can still probably come out of it with more than $60,000 maybe even more.But to do that there are certain emotional issues involved, and to be honest having a friend.. or hopefully that special person.. that special warm soulmate to help me deal with these issues would be a gift from God himself.I hope there is someone OUT there who can understand how it is to be in this situation, and needs a friend (at least!) to TALK TO. In return u would meet a man who:1) has UNLIMITED LOYALTY2) has UMLIMITED affection3) is a good listener4) is someone u can turn to for support, strength, encouragement5) will be tender, romantic, sensual, gentle, loyal, just, kind and warmIf interested all I ask is to meet for coffee in public.. that's all I ask.Hope to hear from you, NormanP.S.

You are not here to give me the apology you owe me, in person.

My roommate who demanded the right to have sex with any man I brought home because she loves their money and their career, while she dealt what is probably the final death blow to my career because she thinks shoving something up her twat is more important than anything else in the whole world.Really. Her twat is more important than art. How many women are there like that in the world? Me, on the other hand?

Oh yeah, I forgot, the reason you aren't fucking my roommate is because she didn't want you, she just wanted what she could get from you.

I have decided to just focus on school, so I do not work due to my fulltime student status for Occupational Therapy. I know their are people that do both but I just rather not jeopardize my grades. Thus creating my stand still. I established myself somewhat and just need a bust in my transportation, a car to be specific. Granted I live in NYC where us New Yorkers are spoiled with the MTA but I'm moving on up. I am a passionate person and like what I like. I am chalk full of multiply business ventures but need a vehicle to get off the ground. I know its a long shot but I am willing on trying. Anything is possible in 2015 and so I'm here.

You were so nerdy and so hot. The too small frame, the small breasts, wrapped in that tight strapless shirt that showed the smooth skin that barely contained those bony shoulders. The dorky pants, and the sparkly shoes that looked too big for you. But the way you moved. You had so much verve, so much kitsch, so much energy. My eyes were glued to you all night...but circumstances made it difficult to connect. I probably got too far into my head about it, but, in trying to be respectful of my friend, when I probably didn't need to be, I missed out on you. But, hey! It's cool. See you on the dancefloor.
