Just before the turnstiles, you almost ran me over, rushing to be first at the NJ Transit ticket machine. A few minutes later, we are standing next to each other down by the escalator on the platform, waiting for the train to Manhattan. Our eyes met multiple times, but my brain was too dead after a long flight to strike up a conversation. It took a railway worker's announcement for us to utter the first few words. You asked me something, and I only managed to say two or three words. A few moments later, we are sitting in the waiting area across from each other, and I glanced at you a few times, unable to keep my eyes off of you. Before boarding the train, we stood next to each other on the platform. You went to sit on the upper deck, I stayed downstairs. I saw you one more time, then lost you at Penn Station. You: dark blond / light brunette hair, light color trench coat, grey jacket, knit sweater, scarf, brown pants, light brown shoes, brown leather duffel bag, maroon handbag, a red leather document briefcase, and a white iPhone 5c with pink ear phones.

Have you noticed that?But here's one thought I have when you say such things to me at thispoint; What would your fiance think if he knew you were still feelingthis way and speaking this way to me? You see, its the same deceit andduplicity that has been there for the last six years, when ourrelationship (or affair) began.He was back there all along - ""Oh we never see each other!"" ""He doesn'ttouch me!"" ""I don't think he cares!"" ""I want to leave but I have nowhereto go!"" ""If I told him I'm in love with you he'd kick me out of thehouse! You don't want me to be homeless, do you?""And now even on your wedding day or on your honeymoon if he were to ask,""So you never slept with him?"" You would say, ""No! he's just a friend! He might have wanted to but I told him I was already in a relationshipwith you!"" Or some such lying thing. . .You and I know the truth, and that makes your wedding a lie. But I'msupposed to play along and think its sweet that you have this secret withhim because it flatters me???And it goes even farther; How do I know I'm the only one that has aspecial status in secret from your schmucky soon-to-be hubby? I don't. He shouldn't trust you, why should I?And so your entreaties of love and our unique bond seem like a fuckinghussle and really just a vampire attack, which I've experienced many timesbefore with you.

I remember you being kind of angry and bossy and impatient, not at me, just in general, like the job was driving you crazy. I could understand, given the circumstances and the ghetto, thuggish crowd you mostly deal with there (on that particular day I saw you, a black man with dreads in the elevator threatened to ""shoot up the place"" because he didn't want to wait on line anymore and you called Security on him... another time I went a 20 something female accused some 70 year old woman of ""flirting with her man"" just because the older lady said excuse me as they formed a queue/line, and the young woman then threatened to beat her up. Ridiculous stuff like that.. You were one of the most intense people I've ever met...You were impeccably dressed in a navy blue suit, a fit white male with dark, dark brown hair and beautiful cheekbones to match intensely blue eyes. There's nothing sexier than a man bossin' a woman around. I need a man like that- one who is 'in charge' and in touch with his masculinity. Naturally dominant, no props needed... Let me stroke that hair and those cheekbones and melt you down...

I wanted the time to think about those questions because I have never been one to just jump into things. I don't know if you were ok with the request for that time. I'm afraid that you weren't ok with that, then again, maybe you were/are and I'm just paranoid - it's not like I never get paranoid (I'm just honest about my paranoia)I know what I would like to have but I don't know if you would like the same thing. I don't know if what I would like is possible and I have to be realistic and say probably not.Are you really back? I think I'd be happy if you said yes.

I am about 5'11"" tall, average build and work in a law firm in Manhattan.I know people have told me not to put too much detail into this post, but I want to begin by being HONEST about my circumstances, what I am looking for, and HOPEFULLY someone out there will have either been in a similar situation, or at least be able to empathize to the point of (I hope) a cup of coffee, at least.First of all about AGE? Doesnt matter.. all my life was in relationships with my age.. yet last gf was 21 and I am late 50s. We were together as a couple for 3 years. She was tired of guys her age who only wanted her for the physical, then left her. She wanted someone more Mature who would truly take time to get to know her as a person. Someone Older who would listen to her thoughts, feelings, respect, care for her.And romantically, someone more Mature who would take time for warmth, affection, Tenderness. Someone who would go slow---hold hands, cuddle, be gentle.That is why it worked.. and why it PROVES when it comes to age it is truly just a number. For feelings are Universal at any age.So if you are in my age range, fine. But if younger, doesnt matter!Either way!OK so that being said, here goes (LOL):Some time ago I lost many things at once:1) Girlfriend of 7 years (she broke up);2) Best male friends of 20 years (they did not die but went their own way)3) My car4) My job (D0NT WORRY I have a good job now)5) And my own place (share for now --divorced for 10 years now, can prove it and saving to get OWN place again in 4 months).Subsequent to all those losses, I did make 1 true friend (platonic) and was in a relationship with a woman for 1-1/2 years, which ended a few months ago (she moved out of NY).At this point, I am seeking a friend to talk to, to do things with.I AM SO TIRED of doing everything ALONE.. it HURTS!Id like to meet a pleasant, warm female companion to share things with.. movies, walks, anything we have in common.I enjoy bowling, outdoors, LOVE nature.. fresh air, trees, and music.Love All kinds of music pretty much.. books, moviesBut most especially just being with a special person.It is NOT easy to be ALONE in NY. And despite the fact I have recovered pretty much from what I pointed out in the 5 points above, being alone again now. Just feels empty.. especially around the holidays!I put this ad in BOTH the platonic section AND the dating section because I am OPEN to both friendship AND romance.I happen to be a very Affectionate person, love to hug, cuddle? I love it.Ultimately, I am looking for a woman I can CHERISH, treasure for her mind, heart and soul? a woman who wants a man who will be LOYAL, TRUSTING, who will stand by her no matter what.. who will be her best friend, her soulmate.A man who she can turn to at all times.. to lean on for strength, emotional support. Who will be tender, gentle, and loving.If ure looking for that too.. not a man who plays games but a man who can be DEVOTED, WARM, loving, a good listener.. empathic.. im here!I am college educated, and fix computers on the side.. so if u need any help with your computer, feel free to ask.OK that's about it.

Not that there'sanything wrong with that, but why on earth would a woman who has anythingto offer a guy give it away for nothing to some horny toad just because he asks?Second, if she is all that then wouldn't she already have one or more guys lined upto casually ""get busy"" if she was ""into"" that sort of thing?Why would many guys here then seek to demean or flag a woman who wants more?It's her life to lead after all, not yours. Being sarcastic, offensive, rude, or flagging won't change her opinion. She doesn't care what you think, nor should she. Third, if a guy doesn't have anything to offer her then why should she take an interest?It's not like having sex or fooling around is considered a form of charity.Fourth, we personally aren't into casual sex or casual fooling around. We think thatit's something meant for your boyfriend or husband. Otherwise how would it be special?We don't see how it could feel right if the guy wasn't our boyfriend or husband.Fifth, if it's a matter of being horny, then okay, we don't consider ourselves to be prudes,but why wouldn't we just masturbate? We of course know our body better than anyone else.Six, if/when we do feel open to fool around on a rare occasion where there isn't a certain relationship, and instead of considering a guy we already know well as a friend, we would be open to consider a guy here, that is IF he is open, doesn't require sex, is perfectly finewith respecting whatever it is we find comfortable, and is willing to provide a contribution that would seem almost impossible to refuse, because it could practically be applied to thingswhich would have us feel appreciated no differently than when we have long-term boyfriends or if we had husbands, then it all comes down to safety.Seven, if one was open to fool around and she has options, why would she consider a site thatguys imply is only about sex and for sex since this means that it's statistically more dangerousin terms of contracting a venereal disease?Eight, we all know that the likelihood of people using Saran Wrap, dental dams or condoms (latex) is extremely rare in general and especially at a site like this where males seem to be so focused on sex and freely expressing their need for sex, so why would someone want to hookupwith a guy who has no value for his life and would play Russian roulette with it?Nine, if someone is willing to provide test results to prove that he's disease free, this is no proof of his activities since he's last been tested.Ten, if a man is willing to provide new test results taken right before you consider fooling around, then what proof is there that he's been abstinent thereafter should you choose to engage such activities again?How many people even if they have been testedin the not too distant past with documentation to prove it, are actually getting tested again immediately before the possibility of sexual activity? Very few.To summarize, our disinterest in hookups doesn't mean that we are lesbian, dislike men or are fat and ugly. In fact, it's the opposite. The above only confirms why certain women aren't sleeping around. It's about value. Yes, we get sexually aroused like everyone else, but we exhibit self-control. The value for our lives and the respect we have for it and ourselves serve as remindersthat we are priceless.AMEN.",40.78019889999999,-73.94600439999999,2015-11-19 22:53:39.296378,2015-11-19 22:53:39.296378,Google Places API

But this is more about letting it off my chest than about finding you. (although nothing is impossible)It was a late Thursday night. I remember because it was Fashion's Night Out. A night of fashion, fun, frugal spending and freebies. I was on my way home, waiting for the G train, which is exceptionally slow past midnight. Me, unconsciously biting my nails. You, probably thinking of something to say to me. You eventually tell me that I shouldn't bite my nails. I didn't even know I was being watched until that point. Its a bad habit of mine and I was hoping to get a free manicure but missed out. I turn and look at you to see a tall man in an all black suit and tie. My mind immediately thinks of security guards. I dont really remember our conversation but i'm pretty sure I hid my nails and rambled about my bad habit and the manicure I was hoping to get. You ask me about my night, I tell you about my night on the town (macys gave out free moscato!), my few celebrity sightings, and my love for fashion in general. I believe the train came by this point. I rushed on to grab my favorite seat by a window. You walk toward me and ask if you can sit in the seat across from me. I couldn't tell if you were joking or serious. So I just laugh it off and continue the conversation.At eye level I finally get a good look at you. I remember thinking you were very handsome and clean cut. I finally ask you about the suit. But first I decided to guess. Loss prevention at century 21? You laugh and say no. I believe you said you were a buyer for a boutique. Of course I ask for details, I just assumed because you were tall that you would be in a field like security. But lo and behold, you were a buyer for a boutique!!! My stop was coming up but I wanted to continue talking to you. So I waited until the last second but you stood as well and we were getting off at the same stop. I asked if you lived in the area and you said yes. Once we were outside you held your hand out for a handshake and told me your name. I remember thinking that you were so formal, since I didn't usually come across guys like that. I shook your hand and told you my name. You ask for my number and I didn't hesitate even though you were a stranger. I had already decided that you were a nice guy by your actions. As we were about to part ways you tell me not to forget your name and I said I wont. I even repeat it to reassure you.I haven't forgotten this encounter even though it was 3 years ago. As I was walking home I remember hoping that you would text or call the next day because I was a freshman in college with no job and my phone bill was not paid. I knew it would be cutting off in a few days.Unfortunately, I didn't hear from you before my phone cut off. A few months passed and i'm focusing on school. With my full time school schedule, i'm unable to work and was without a cell phone for that whole time.But one day, (I kid you not I am not making this up), while on the bus with my mom, my phone starts to ring. It took me a while to realize that it was my phone ringing, because I hadn't paid my bill and I was on a bus full of people, so I thought it was someone else's. I pick up the phone even though it was an unrecognizable number, and guess who it is?! Once you say your name I immediately remember that night on the train. Because you told me not to forget your name, I never forgot it.I'm so shocked that you were calling and that my phone was receiving a call, that I don't even know what to say. I remember you saying that you thought I had given you a wrong number. Then I explained the whole phone cutting off thing. I don't remember the conversation after that, but we did make plans eventually. We never actually met up, but our last conversation was while I was working on an art project at a gallery. You called me but you sounded busy. We were at different points in our lives. Me being 18 and you in your late 20s, it just wasn't working out. Even with that weird moment when my phone started receiving calls out of the blue.To this day I always think about you. All the what ifs. This is just a reminder not to let missed connections get away. I remember your name and also your birthday. During our first conversation on the train, I felt an instant connection. I probably asked you when your birthday was. When I told you mine you said you had the same birthday as me, but I didn't believe you at first. Even recalling this right now, Im trying to figure out why it had to be a missed connection. Maybe when the time is right we will connect again. Side note : You lived in my area but we never bumped into each other again. Maybe you moved away. Hopefully you are like me, and you check this section sometime in the future.

Tall with a lanky frame. You have brown eyes and wavy brown hair. You live somewhere in New York and I'm fairly certain that your name is Mike. I've never met you before in my life, but I had a dream about you last night.I'm an artist and apparently so are you. In my dream, we were walking around with a very large group of people, painting and postering the corridors of an empty college somewhere. Each time one of us had finished our section of a wall or door, the entire group would then gather to the location of the piece to marvel at the finished product. Towards the end of the dream, I came upon the most fantastic work of all. The wall itself was huge and on this enormous workspace, the artist had affixed many colorful posters with ornate decals and all sorts of interesting things. A lot of care went into this piece and I stood there captivated by the wall as I waited for everyone else to regroup.Once the entire crowd had gathered to inspect the wall, all of these nice, artsy, friendly people suddenly became an angry mob. They all began booing in unison and shouting mean things about the subject matter. Most of the posters contained anti-war sentiments and a lot of writing that spoke in condemnation of the Iraq War.That's when I saw you. You pushed your way to the front of the crowd and you vehemently tore down everything this talented person had so painstakingly affixed to the wall. Enboldened by your actions, everyone else followed your lead and began tearing all of this artwork to bits. When every last scrap of it was gone, you all seemed quite satisified with yourselves and most of the crowd scattered off to their respective locations. I looked at you, scrutinizing the bare wall, and I said, ""Hey! Do you know who made this one?""""Oh,"" you said. ""I did.""I walked over to an empty cafeteria table, put my knees up to my chest and I cried there for a long time.

657,5312201824,For the girl who wanted to hear a story - m4w,2015-11-12 10:01,/brk/mis/5312201824.html,brk,m4w,"","So I saw a girl on here the other day asking to hear a story, but her post was deleted before I could respond. So I guess I'm writing on the whim she'll see. Anyhow here goes. So when I was in highschool my mom was diagnosed with cancer. It sucked obviously, but my father had a good job so we as a family could deal with it fairly well. But after a couple year I suppose the stress got to him, he became depressed and lost his job, and with it all of our health benefits.(We didn't tell my mom because we thought it would only stress her out more). Anyhow cancer bills are expensive as fuck, and our family savings account started to run low after awhile, so my father came to me asking if I had any way to get money. He was on the verge of tears and I could tell it killed him to ask me for it but I told him I could try to find a way. I had been boxing since I was in middle school, and had been in amateur fights for a bit, so I asked my trainer if he could get me into anything that would pay me. I explained the situation to him and every month or so I would get in the ring with some asshole and afterwards get a couple bucks. I'd come home with a bloody ass face and give my dad a handful of cash so he could try to pay the bills, but after about a year like that I suppose my father felt guilty and told my mom what I had been doing to keep her alive. So when I came home one day they were on the couch and told me to come over. I sat down and my mother told me she loved me very much but she didn't want me wasting my money and time on her just as I was about to leave highschool and start college. I begged her not to but the next day she called her doctors and told them she no longer wanted treatment. She died several weeks later. My father was then committed to mental hospitals on and off while I went off to college until one day I came home for break to find him hanging from the rafters with a noose around his neck. Anyhow If somehow you see this (whomever asked for a story) then there you go. Sorry if I made you sad.",40.7127837,-74.0059413,2015-11-19 22:59:40.118083,2015-11-19 22:59:40.118083,Google Places API

Someone who is comfortable in their own skin, down-to-earth, hilarious, thoughtful, nostalgic, and is mostly an open book. Oh and vital: be young at heart.

As the water dripped you made a funny gesture like you were showering.I saw you in my art history class on the 354th floor of The NYU Universe.

Thats all I want to know.I saw you glance at me up and down in an elitist, uninterested manner on 12th and Broadway. So I assume you liked what you saw. I was in a light trenchcoat and black heels with a talking Louis Vuitton bag that was discussing politics to a vender on the street.I saw you at Central Park with your dog. You were reading a book to him on architecture and dead trees. Topics far too eccentric for even Liberaci's taste.Â I saw you on the C train toward Bubble Bath Island.

I have met a few women on CL, and they have even been very attractive and hot. Two were tourists. one was a divorced woman who had no interest in relationships and 3 others were just looking for a huge cock and/or some particular kink. I gave it to them.women like to get laid and to fuck. One of the ladies I was with said she was tired of getting to know a guy only to find out he was below average in bed too late. It makes sense to use CL and get what your looking for and not take a random chance on the guy at the bar being a good lay or whatever else you really want. This whole idea that you have to ""offer something more"" is the same mindset hookers have.. they want to cash in the pussy for a price. I have less respect for women who play that game than the type of woman who has sex for it's own sake. a woman who uses her vagina as some prize that extracts monetary or emotional good from a man is worse than a whore- at least a whore is honest and doesn't mislead you and play with your emotions. that type of women never really loves a man she is with, but merely sees him as a thing to be used. How low is that?I'm all for relationships, and I'd consider a relationship with a woman I met here more than I would some prissy judgemental game player who sees sex as a reward for good behavior or as a way to get goodies- emotional or otherwise.When you count dating sites, apps like tinder etc.. what we are seeing is women being more upfront about sex as an honest vehicle for their enjoyment, on their own terms, and that should be encouraged.

849,5326904184,just an opinion hookups or sex,2015-11-21 23:18,/lgi/mis/5326904184.html,lgi,sex,"","I wouldn't call them mutually inclusive. I think each individual decides the meaning of sex for themselves. Hookups pretty much says what has been decided. what I think of hookups would sound derogatory, its just not what I decided and if honest consenting adults agree, who's to say. then there are those who try to discover by experimenting. I personally think you are ""wiring"" yourself with experiences you may regret if you don't have the foresight to allow yourself that with an open mind, again, not for me. those who treat it as something too sacred may discover in a long term relationship or union, that ""sex"" will be many things, an expression and celebration of love, assurance and comfort, affirmation if you will during stormy times, then occasionally man or woman has an urge that needs to be satisfied and has the luxury of a willing partner they love, but that night it wont be about love and that's ok. so I think it's not about what sex is, but just declaring for yourself what it will be. I've had the misfortune to see women lose their ""compass"", when it is pleasurable to the point of obsession with just one aspect of life, do anything ,say anything, pretend it is anything for it to continue on. to see that the majority of energy, availability and focus was on sex. to tear herself and the other up over coming to terms with that, and when the other discovers such a thing doesn't want that, there is hell to pay. I respect anyone who is at least honest up front what it means to them and respects the others choice. leverage, just an urge to be satisfied, an act of love or a reward for being what somebody wanted you to be, if its up front, understood, let like minded people find each other. Both arguments I hear it is nothing to do with love, one is urges to be satisfied the other a prize for being a resource to you, to each their own. As for my experience with women, it was sad to see those who discovered too late that for some men it did represent what they had dreamed it should and given up on it..........till. sorry to disappoint but some do ""fuck"" with their heart, get it broken discovering it wasn't love but just the sex for her. What a man can do to a woman when he loves her and her the same, i'll say no thanks to everything else to protect that.",40.725400,-73.516600,2015-11-23 21:58:18.024819,2015-11-23 21:58:18.024819,detail page

She is on Craigslist 24-7 trying to get men to cheat on their significant others. She is quite repulsive looking and her personality resembles that of a wet mop. She pretends to be intelligent and tries to act like some comic loser guy's fantasy girl when in reality she is nothing she pretends to be. There are impressionable, vulnerable, inexperienced, dorky, pathetic men out there who will buy into this and their innate beer goggles will come on and their weak minds will actually entertain this. Please find out if your ""nerdyish"" or if you are dating or are married to a somewhat ""urban"" type guy who might be frequenting Craigslist singles behind your back if he is talking to her. She is ridiculous and ruthless. She will stand in front of your spouses building to catch a glimpse. She will follow you and/or him around because she thinks ""she got this"". These are the words she uses when she is trying to get your guy to do something bad. Please nip it in the bud when you catch wind of this.

As the water dripped you made a funny gesture like you were showering.I saw you in my art history class on the 354th floor of The NYU Universe. The professor began complaining about the students not handing their homework in on time and you interrupted with a stupendous fart. Did you eat falafel for breakfast? Thats all I want to know.I saw you glance at me up and down in an elitist, uninterested manner on 12th and Broadway. So I assume you liked what you saw. I was in a light trenchcoat and black heels with a talking Louis Vuitton bag that was discussing politics to a vender on the street.I saw you at Central Park with your dog. You were reading a book to him on architecture and dead trees. Topics far too eccentric for even Liberaci's taste.Â I saw you on the C train toward Bubble Bath Island. You looked like a cross between Yoko Ono and Alec Baldwin- certainly a strange combination but you seemed to pull it off. I am happily married but definitely down for Hot Pockets sometime if you have a microwave.I saw you running from the cops this evening at around 79th St and Watermelon Ave. You bumped into me and I spilled my diet Dr. Pepper all over my newborn baby. I shouted ""Hey Asshole, watch where you're going!"" You told me to go fuck myself and then you winked. Anyway if you want to see that new Steve Jobs movie with me sometime, shoot me an email. Tell me what kind of knife you were holding so I know its really you.I saw you at that rotten job I left months ago. I always wanted to say hi, but was too shy to approach you. Your talent was intimidating. But my coworker informed me that you didn't know what fracking was- maaaaaajor turn off dude.I saw you waking up in my bed and leaving quietly to return to your wife on the UWS. I'm pretty sure your underpants featured a Dr. Seuss character. Wish I had gotten your name.",40.740200,-73.999600,2015-11-23 22:12:16.379917,2015-11-23 22:12:16.379917,detail page

I have met a few women on CL, and they have even been very attractive and hot. Two were tourists. one was a divorced woman who had no interest in relationships and 3 others were just looking for a huge cock and/or some particular kink. I gave it to them.women like to get laid and to fuck. One of the ladies I was with said she was tired of getting to know a guy only to find out he was below average in bed too late. It makes sense to use CL and get what your looking for and not take a random chance on the guy at the bar being a good lay or whatever else you really want. This whole idea that you have to ""offer something more"" is the same mindset hookers have.. they want to cash in the pussy for a price. I have less respect for women who play that game than the type of woman who has sex for it's own sake. a woman who uses her vagina as some prize that extracts monetary or emotional good from a man is worse than a whore- at least a whore is honest and doesn't mislead you and play with your emotions. that type of women never really loves a man she is with, but merely sees him as a thing to be used. How low is that?I'm all for relationships, and I'd consider a relationship with a woman I met here more than I would some prissy judgemental game player who sees sex as a reward for good behavior or as a way to get goodies- emotional or otherwise.When you count dating sites, apps like tinder etc.. what we are seeing is women being more upfront about sex as an honest vehicle for their enjoyment, on their own terms, and that should be encouraged. Not the manipulative gameplaying we see from the original poster.","","",2015-11-23 22:13:01.166799,2015-11-23 22:13:01.166799,detail page

I think each individual decides the meaning of sex for themselves. Hookups pretty much says what has been decided. what I think of hookups would sound derogatory, its just not what I decided and if honest consenting adults agree, who's to say. then there are those who try to discover by experimenting. I personally think you are ""wiring"" yourself with experiences you may regret if you don't have the foresight to allow yourself that with an open mind, again, not for me. those who treat it as something too sacred may discover in a long term relationship or union, that ""sex"" will be many things, an expression and celebration of love, assurance and comfort, affirmation if you will during stormy times, then occasionally man or woman has an urge that needs to be satisfied and has the luxury of a willing partner they love, but that night it wont be about love and that's ok. so I think it's not about what sex is, but just declaring for yourself what it will be. I've had the misfortune to see women lose their ""compass"", when it is pleasurable to the point of obsession with just one aspect of life, do anything ,say anything, pretend it is anything for it to continue on. to see that the majority of energy, availability and focus was on sex. to tear herself and the other up over coming to terms with that, and when the other discovers such a thing doesn't want that, there is hell to pay. I respect anyone who is at least honest up front what it means to them and respects the others choice. leverage, just an urge to be satisfied, an act of love or a reward for being what somebody wanted you to be, if its up front, understood, let like minded people find each other. Both arguments I hear it is nothing to do with love, one is urges to be satisfied the other a prize for being a resource to you, to each their own. As for my experience with women, it was sad to see those who discovered too late that for some men it did represent what they had dreamed it should and given up on it..........till. sorry to disappoint but some do ""fuck"" with their heart, get it broken discovering it wasn't love but just the sex for her. What a man can do to a woman when he loves her and her the same, i'll say no thanks to everything else to protect that.",40.725400,-73.516600,2015-11-23 22:13:02.833041,2015-11-23 22:13:02.833041,detail page

But during both intervals (and afterwards) you were in lively conversation with an older man, and it didn't seem polite to interrupt, much as I was tempted to. . . So, on the off chance that you might look on this website: perhaps you remember me: I was in blue jeans, a short-sleeved blue shirt and was probably the only other person there under the age of 60. . .How'd you like the opera??","","",2015-11-23 22:13:17.034943,2015-11-23 22:13:17.034943,detail page

1082,5326471316,reply (1) to 'the thing about hookups' - w4m,2015-11-21 16:39,/brk/mis/5326471316.html,brk,w4m,"no, you have it mostly wrong","Her post was well-written but way off on some points. I can show exactly where the gaps are. She's basically suggesting we have no rational for what we do, but that is incorrect.1. First, the males here appear to be extremely superficial.True, but its much better to state that THIS CITY is the capital of superficiality. Both men and women are superficial here. To truly outlandish proportions. Sure, its obvious that men have an emphatic and definitive way of being superficial. But men and women are raised differently-- and have different biology, Women cheat as much as men do, but they do it discreetly. So who is really 'better' morally? No one.Consider this too: men's focus on sex is not really all THAT superficial because after all, sex is a core biological need and also one of the few ways humans can connect with each other. It may appear crass in today's day and age to pursue it so single-mindedly; but that's not really our fault. Men from *any era* are driven towards sex.2. but why on earth would a woman who has anythingto offer a guy give it away for nothing to some horny toad just because he asks?(For 'why give it away for nothing', see #5 below). As for 'why we ask': well, we come straight out and ask for sex because we don't need anything else from you. Remember: this society is a patriarchy, and men are the primary breadwinners. Every man has earning ability for himself. We don't need any monetary help from women. Thus, we don't let money affect our romantic choices at all. Can you babes say the same?Think about it. What else do we really need from you except sex? This is why we can afford to come right out and ask. We don't have any other need to 'bargain with you' for anything else.Any other type of conversation (romantic, or courting, or polite fencing) would--if a man were to engage in it--be akin to 'playing games'. That's your schtick, not ours.'Lengthy conversation' is a tool for a woman to 'size up' the man interested in her. She uses it to assess his viability to support her, to entertain her, she uses it to verify his social status. All of these 'extra concerns' come into play on YOUR side. Its just a bit ulterior and underhanded, wouldn't you say?3. ... if she is all that then wouldn't she already have one or more guys lined upto casually ""get busy"" if she was ""into"" that sort of thing?Yes. Which is why there are no really attractive, honest females on CList. Its all just scams and shills looking for 'support' and 'sugar daddies'. Whereas men at least have the directness to only come here asking for satisfaction of the simplest, most animal, most basic urge. We don't try to get anything else from females. We don't scam you for anything you shouldn't give up naturally. Not so, with females--they visit Clist not only seeking sex but seeking 'other gains'.So I ask you; who is more honest and above-board?4. Why would many guys here then seek to demean or flag a woman who wants more?It's her life to lead after all, not yours. Being sarcastic, offensive, rude, or flaggingwon't change her opinion. She doesn't care what you think, nor should she.You're correct. Flaggers are pathetic; they waste their time with pointless flagging. When a woman is on CList essentially 'playing the whore role' there is little chance of shaming her. She won't understand the basis for the shame. All she knows is she wants fiscal benefits as a 'perk' for her company. I guess it just irks us to see a whore 'thinking she's clever' or 'pretending-to-herself' that she isn't what she is.5. ...if a guy doesn't have anything to offer her then why should she take an interest?This is where you reveal a massive blind spot. The answer to your question rests right there in your question when you insist on ""being offered something"".Remember: sex is enjoyable by both men and women EQUALLY. Both sexes benefit from having sex--orgasms are the goal of both. So why then, should one side of the sexual union (women) seek or receive 'something extra'? Why should men have to 'offer' you anything?I put it to you. Why do women want some kind of 'extra recompense' ...for an activity which appeases both equally? You gloss right over this in all your theorizing.6. It's not like having sex or fooling around is considered a form of charity.Certainly not, since both parties receive pleasure from it. We men sure don't see sex as 'charity', but you women sure seem to see our wallets as a fund to console you for 'the loss' (of something) if you have sex with us. Why is that?This is not 'cheapness talking', either. We're willing to pay, but that *doesn't make it ethical* of you to expect it. After all, how would you react if we men began insisting you pay us (buy us dinner, auto-parts, power tools, etc) for the pleasure of our cocks? Well? No good, right? Right. You're in a seller's market. So enjoy it. It's the only market you can be in.See...your need for courtship is a darn shame. It certainly burdens you. But you can't take it out on us.7. ..we personally aren't into casual sex or casual fooling around. We think thatit's something meant for your boyfriend or husband. Otherwise how would it be special?We don't see how it could feel right if the guy wasn't our boyfriend or husband.Unfortunately, this is your (you and your friend's) individual emotional hangup. Its not how we men experience life, sex, or relationships. Nor, do many more mature women approach romance this way. Grown-ups just don't need sex to be 'special'. Your sentimentalism is just the emotional boondoggle of young girls. Its also why you have an affinity for children and child-rearing (children and girls inhabit the same emotional plane).Nevertheless, you just can't blame other types of adults for not being in this same boat with you. Viewing sex *unemotionally* is perfectly valid--whether or not you happen to believe so. If you had twenty more years of sexual experience, you would probably shake-your-heads-in-wonder at the emotionally-fragile, young-ingenue's plea you just expressed.8. ... if it's a matter of being horny, then okay, we don't consider ourselves to be prudes,but why wouldn't we just masturbate?Because you have emotional needs, economic needs, a need-for-status(marriage), and biological needs (childbirth). And well--you can't get any of those urges satisfied by masturbation. No woman wants to wind up a 'spinster' or an 'old-maid', do they?9. We of course know our body better than anyone else. If/when we do feel open to fool around on a rare occasion where there isn't a certain relationship, and instead of considering a guy we already know well as a friend, we would be open to consider a guy here, that is IF he is open, doesn't require sex, is perfectly fine with respecting whatever it is we find comfortable, and is willing to provide a contribution that would seem almost impossible to refuse, because it could practically be applied to things which would have us feel appreciated no differently than when we have long-term boyfriends or if we had husbands, then it all comes down to safety.This dense and confusing mishmash is basically a wishy-washy way of saying that sexually, you 'want to have your cake and eat it too'. In other words, you can't perceive casual sex as anything but a 'breaking of your goals' and therefore, it needs some kind of 'extra dividend' ...quite unfairly, paid for, by males.But again--since men aren't burdened by such emotionalism (we don't confuse sex with love) why should we pay for the guilt you feel when you 'obey your body' rather than 'follow your agenda'?10...if one was open to fool around and she has options, why would she consider a site thatguys imply is only about sex and for sex since this means that it's statistically more dangerousin terms of contracting a venereal disease?You're correct here (and in the rest of your arguments about STDs, as well).No argument from me on that score. CList is all about diseases. It doesn't mean though, that you can just walk away from sexual relationships. If you don't meet men via CList, you'd need to meet them some other way. The same predicament exists anywhere and everywhere you may turn. Its an age-old dilemma, but the bald truth is that women need to offer casual sex if they want to land a long-term romantic relationship. It sucks, but that is just how it is. So: play 'the game' carefully, and try to find a worthwhile guy out there who is a 'keeper'. But don't blame us for our biology. See, we get sexual urges every few seconds. As a woman, you need to 'take care of our needs' --if you want us to stay joined to you. This is not news. This is the way of the world, and always has been. Jane Austen can tell you so!You either measure up to it --the way women always have--or you remain stunted, babyish, little girls. There's no shortcut for you either, just because you live in the age of the cell-phone. (In fact, cell-phones AGGRAVATE the problem. Drop the cellphone lifestyle and you probably stand a better chance of making a good LTR with someone).11. The above only confirms why certain women aren't sleeping around. It's about value.Yes, we get sexually aroused like everyone else, but we exhibit self-control.The value for our lives and the respect we have for it and ourselves serve as remindersthat we are priceless.No. This is just 'conceit'. Vaginas very definitely DO have a price. Whores have vaginas, so do princesses, so do wealthy socialites, every woman has a vagina; and every woman has a price of some sort. The *winners* are women who use their vaginas for what they were intended (sex) without using them as a bargaining chip.Men will always get laid one way or another. So if you 'keep yourself off the market' because you are too delicate; too refined; too squeamish ...'too tender to mix in with the dirt of living'--then that is nothing more than being FOOLISH. 'Keep yourself on the shelf' ...and you simply lose out--on life.And it hurts everyone else, too. *Decreasingly* eligible women mean that men turn more piggish and more crass-- instead of improving into the gentlemen and princes you desire. If you reduce the number of sexually-accessible women you just make us more desperate, more impatient, and more foul. You hasten the 'race to the bottom'. Catch-22!You got questions...I have answers. Hope this helped.",40.688615,-73.989168,2015-11-23 22:13:21.550589,2015-11-23 22:13:21.550589,detail page

First, the males here appear to be extremely superficial. Not that there'sanything wrong with that, but why on earth would a woman who has anythingto offer a guy give it away for nothing to some horny toad just because he asks?Second, if she is all that then wouldn't she already have one or more guys lined upto casually ""get busy"" if she was ""into"" that sort of thing?Why would many guys here then seek to demean or flag a woman who wants more?It's her life to lead after all, not yours. Being sarcastic, offensive, rude, or flagging won't change her opinion. She doesn't care what you think, nor should she. Third, if a guy doesn't have anything to offer her then why should she take an interest?It's not like having sex or fooling around is considered a form of charity.Fourth, we personally aren't into casual sex or casual fooling around. We think thatit's something meant for your boyfriend or husband. Otherwise how would it be special?We don't see how it could feel right if the guy wasn't our boyfriend or husband.Fifth, if it's a matter of being horny, then okay, we don't consider ourselves to be prudes,but why wouldn't we just masturbate? We of course know our body better than anyone else.Six, if/when we do feel open to fool around on a rare occasion where there isn't a certain relationship, and instead of considering a guy we already know well as a friend, we would be open to consider a guy here, that is IF he is open, doesn't require sex, is perfectly finewith respecting whatever it is we find comfortable, and is willing to provide a contribution that would seem almost impossible to refuse, because it could practically be applied to thingswhich would have us feel appreciated no differently than when we have long-term boyfriends or if we had husbands, then it all comes down to safety.Seven, if one was open to fool around and she has options, why would she consider a site thatguys imply is only about sex and for sex since this means that it's statistically more dangerousin terms of contracting a venereal disease?Eight, we all know that the likelihood of people using Saran Wrap, dental dams or condoms (latex) is extremely rare in general and especially at a site like this where males seem to be so focused on sex and freely expressing their need for sex, so why would someone want to hookupwith a guy who has no value for his life and would play Russian roulette with it?Nine, if someone is willing to provide test results to prove that he's disease free, this is no proof of his activities since he's last been tested.Ten, if a man is willing to provide new test results taken right before you consider fooling around, then what proof is there of abstinence thereafter should you choose to engage such activities again?How many people even if they have been testedin the not too distant past with documentation to prove it, are actually getting tested again immediately before the possibility of sexual activity? Very few.To summarize, our disinterest in hookups doesn't mean that we are lesbian, dislike men or are fat and ugly. In fact, it's the opposite. The above only confirms why certain women aren't sleeping around. It's about value. Yes, we get sexually aroused like everyone else, but we exhibit self-control. The value for our lives and the respect we have for it and ourselves serve as remindersthat we are priceless.AMEN.","","",2015-11-23 22:14:40.027706,2015-11-23 22:14:40.027706,detail page

1182,5324406886,Re: I guess this is it - Reply. - m4w,2015-11-20 11:26,/brk/mis/5324406886.html,brk,m4w,Brooklyn,"✨❤️✨❤️✨❤️- Congratulations on your engagement! - ✨❤️✨❤️✨❤️✨To avoid confusion - Non of the other Craigslist ads currently up are mine. I only reply to Craigslist ad email like I did a few days to you :) - mainly to avoid imposters leading you or me on. I wanted to hold out on sending you a reply because I meant it when I said I would give you the time and space you need, but alas the latest Ad of yours is up and I would like you to hear me out before you do anything drastic. I wrote the following except last week, please don't do anything drastic!Response to Craigslist Ad: I'm not over you, I'm over it.I'm still at a shelter and I have guy sleeping 4 feet away who got out of prison for murde. . ... 2 people (only served 15 years) he's clearly unstable and has anger issues and he takes it out on me, its scary, he could snap at any moment, the building is filled with cases like this, its very stressful, the firth time I got out at Union Square I was in shock, sane people everywhere our age happily walking around, some with boyfriends and girlfriends, I couldn't really handle it, I left shortly after. It made me realise how much I missed the most basic and simple things that most people take for granted. I can't remember the last time I had a normal meal, or normal and engaging conversation with sane people or what its like to live without a curfew. I know what I need to work on getting, real food, job, money, friends, GF, just to look down at a smiling face.I want you to know that if you are in a relationship and things are going really well and I don't want to do anything to disrupt that, nor do I want to bring my incredibly despairing situation upon you, I don't expect you or anyone else to save me, nor would it be fair for you to deal with my dramatic fall. I can't stand to seeing you hurting.To answer your question; I would be very happy to remain friends, nothing wrong with that! I've already met other females, going so far as to spend the last of my cash on cocktails and tips, the connection just wasn't there. But if you just want to be friends, like we originally planed, I'll keep searching for someone who makes me as happy as I was with you and keep the friendship between us.Would be nice to hear from you again, I'd love to hear how you're doing, how are you? are you seeing someone? are you happy? what are you up to theses days? did you have a nice summer? It would be really nice to see you and your little buddy again :)Response to Craigslist Ad: I guess this is it Yes I am very lonely, anyone in my situation would be very lonely going through everything on their own it is very painful. But you must understand that I never reached out just to get your attention, my feelings for you are very real and they don't have anything to do with filling the void or finding purpose in life, I really think you're special, I don't care what anyone else says about you, I know you're really great person, I mean I was aroused by thoughts of you half an hour ago, does that make me crazy?I know we're not getting younger. I know I have to consider marriage to a sexy, unique and kickass partner in crime sometime soon who's willing to to go on a wild ride with me, put up with my intense passion, maybe have some kids too. I don't want to die alone thats for sure. Since the breakup I wanted to be their for you the entire time, It was very very hard seeing you hurt, it tears me up. I wasn't just trying to get back with you I was also trying to communicate, to clear up the confusion and help you. I've always wanted you to be happy and I really believe that that we can find peace, you don't need to do anything drastic like erase me form you life. I don't want you to be miserable till spring. I have done research about your condition and relize now that I should have done some things differently.The ambition to do something great is still there, I just haven't seen the light. might not see it for a long time, I want to get back on my feet and have a real career, be successful and a have roof over my head. Thats what I'm focused on now. Thats on me.I promise my love won't interfere with friendshsip,we could remain friends, even if we never fuck, do what best friends do or go to places we dream of. I'd love to help where I can with your wedding, I'm a resourceful guy. . .. . .. . ..if you preferred putting friendship on hold, until I found someone else, that would be fine with me.Please meet me half way, if after the first day you don't think it'll work, I'll honour whatever very you wish to become of it, no protestations or drama. No one understands me like you do, thats rare and I don't want to loose that, so please be brave and believe its possible. I miss waking up to that beautiful tangle of hair in the morning and cooking breakfast, walking down the sidewalk together or your sweet lips, phew amazing. I miss the simplest things about you.If I had a choice, If I could do it all over again I'd make sure I don't hurt you. I'm just so passionate for you, I don't want that to die, I love and miss you.On the craigslist Ad you said I should just contact you directly, I was actually thinking it be best if you contacted me first via my gmail email, text message or FaceTime. . .. the latter two options might not work since my I don't have mobile credit.","","",2015-11-23 22:15:24.316719,2015-11-23 22:15:24.316719,detail page

My farewell set me free from her for good. when I told I could not feel ""awful"" for her because she has no empathy for others whatsoever? her response, to through everybody, anybody under the bus to open the door again. innocent ppl of no consequences to her and I. So if your theory about karma is true.......what makes you think she isn't suffering it now. to me that would be a waste of ""karma"". a selfish, deceiving soul will NEVER, NEVER, NEVER change. that is the lesson I learned. so support your friend, your right, but don't be so sure you really know her or anything about ""karma"". i'll take the moral authority every man should. peace of mind, I was there for her when I knew she would not be the same for me; I was to her what she would never be to me; I was what she wanted. someone just for her, not to use as a resource, take from her, run her to death, outgrow her and leave her abandoned and alone, unless I need something else. no whats understood is she will never be ""someone just for me"" . so I don't know a polite way to say fuck you and your stupidity in not seeing why she is sooo devasted. but it's your turn , you will discover. if your response is not mistaken. if i'm garbage and was more than she ever could be to me, there when I had a right to say no more, you worry about what that must make her. she only took and demanded, her vacation is over.",40.725400,-73.516600,2015-11-23 22:16:05.263876,2015-11-23 22:16:05.263876,detail page

I am about 5'11"" tall, average build and work in a law firm in Manhattan.I know people have told me not to put too much detail into this post, but I want to begin by being HONEST about my circumstances, what I am looking for, and HOPEFULLY someone out there will have either been in a similar situation, or at least be able to empathize to the point of (I hope) a cup of coffee, at least.First of all about AGE? Doesnt matter.. all my life was in relationships with my age.. yet last gf was 21 and I am late 50s. We were together as a couple for 3 years. She was tired of guys her age who only wanted her for the physical, then left her. She wanted someone more Mature who would truly take time to get to know her as a person. Someone Older who would listen to her thoughts, feelings, respect, care for her.And romantically, someone more Mature who would take time for warmth, affection, Tenderness. Someone who would go slow---hold hands, cuddle, be gentle.That is why it worked.. and why it PROVES when it comes to age it is truly just a number. For feelings are Universal at any age.So if you are in my age range, fine. But if younger, doesnt matter!Either way!OK so that being said, here goes (LOL):Some time ago I lost many things at once:1) Girlfriend of 7 years (she broke up);2) Best male friends of 20 years (they did not die but went their own way)3) My car4) My job (D0NT WORRY I have a good job now)5) And my own place (share for now --divorced for 10 years now, can prove it and saving to get OWN place again in 4 months).Subsequent to all those losses, I did make 1 true friend (platonic) and was in a relationship with a woman for 1-1/2 years, which ended a few months ago (she moved out of NY).At this point, I am seeking a friend to talk to, to do things with.I AM SO TIRED of doing everything ALONE.. it HURTS!Id like to meet a pleasant, warm female companion to share things with.. movies, walks, anything we have in common.I enjoy bowling, outdoors, LOVE nature.. fresh air, trees, and music.Love All kinds of music pretty much.. books, moviesBut most especially just being with a special person.It is NOT easy to be ALONE in NY. And despite the fact I have recovered pretty much from what I pointed out in the 5 points above, being alone again now. Just feels empty.. especially around the holidays!I put this ad in BOTH the platonic section AND the dating section because I am OPEN to both friendship AND romance.I happen to be a very Affectionate person, love to hug, cuddle? I love it.Ultimately, I am looking for a woman I can CHERISH, treasure for her mind, heart and soul? a woman who wants a man who will be LOYAL, TRUSTING, who will stand by her no matter what.. who will be her best friend, her soulmate.A man who she can turn to at all times.. to lean on for strength, emotional support. Who will be tender, gentle, and loving.If ure looking for that too.. not a man who plays games but a man who can be DEVOTED, WARM, loving, a good listener.. empathic.. im here!I am college educated, and fix computers on the side.. so if u need any help with your computer, feel free to ask.OK that's about it. IF you are looking for an older man or a man your age that you can talk to, lean on, who will listen to your feelings or just have fun with, please write me.All I ask is that if you are interested, to meet for coffee and talk.. that?s all I ask. IN PUBLIC of course so u feel SAFE.. and play it all by ear from there.I am trying very much to get my own place in COUPLE of months.. still paying for co op where I live with ex wife.. have own room she dates I date. its just financial.But I want to sell the coop soon this year.. its probably worth almost $250,000.. even when I split proceeds with ex wife (which I have to do by law- can still probably come out of it with more than $60,000 maybe even more.But to do that there are certain emotional issues involved, and to be honest having a friend.. or hopefully that special person.. that special warm soulmate to help me deal with these issues would be a gift from God himself.I hope there is someone OUT there who can understand how it is to be in this situation, and needs a friend (at least!) to TALK TO.

Idc if it's a fantasy or what ever the situation is. My heart has so much love. And this love belongs to you. Claim your prize lol. Happy thanksgiving I do wish the absolute best for you and your loved ones. And ummm I so desperately want to be one of those loved ones. Anyway Michele you are so beautiful imagine how beautiful you are to me as love= Michele. I would need so much help if you don't love me. Without you telling me the truth my life will be one big question with every thought hurtful as I was deeply in love with you and your smile and your cute nose. I know your smart strong willed stubborn as hell. Specially to me. But you know my life revolves around you. You my friend had my life on pause since 97. I had no thoughts of my future cause you were my stepping stone for my future. Maybe your right I am obsessed and dillisional and displayed stalking behavior but I need to see talk. To you as you are such a big part of it. How do I tell myself Michele wants nothing and will want nothing to ever do with you. When thoughts cross your mind there's no smile? There's no love felt from your heart to me. Missed loved is what you are. Let's just have the loved there. May your first bite of thanksgiving dinner bring a smile to your face from a happy imagine/ thought of terry. Thinking of you. It's impossible not to. You take 95% of my energy. And yes I have no plan. I need you to say hi then we could plan such a life. Maybe I'm a fool to feel it's knot over with the two of us as I hold on to that hope and faith that love does not fade when it's true love and that my loved one has my heart not willing to let go. Maybe being a cancer fucked me on this one as I can't let go of you. You mean to much to terry. He wants to kiss you. Brief words in between but kissing you is something I want so bad in this lifetime. K. No more Rampling or confessing how much I love you. Or how much I hurt. Just want you to know this heart has love for you. Has held wants to share. I love you. Well my heart loves you. I upset at you lol.

But we didn't interact. I've made promises to myself to act next time I do feel any sort of energy towards anyone, and acknowledge that a connection exists. I thought through scenarios in my head...would I ask you to try a smoothie, I wondered what your voice sounded like. As you were near my table I was with a customer, fumbling over my words, feeling your presence around me. My body became nervous, and before I knew it you left. I watched you check out and exit. I thought I saw you glance back at me as you left. I wonder, was that connection two-sided?

I believed then and still believe now that you are the one for me. Though the situation I am in now would make it difficult, I would do it for you. Does it make me selfish?

I was done, not interested in stories, lies or manipulation. just bored to death with such a shallow person, no depth of soul, maybe no soul. you will get through this, the sooner you let go of such things, it WILL feel like everything is going your way compared to what you endure now. the irony, away from me, her life seemed to be disintegrating under her feet. call it karma, anger the gods, whatever, but it spooked me even more . it seemed as all the lies and harm she has done to others was claiming her. it felt like she angered something for forsaking a second chance just to be a better person no strings attached. I say leave it behind you, take off the rear view mirror and hit the gas. i'm glad I did, I don't give a shit about words that come out of a liars mouth, she never loved me, all she has done? she never loved anybody including herself. you cant give love if you don't have it. she would never tell another soul what she told me, that perhaps she doesn't know how to love anybody, probably the only truth she ever said. so all that said, does it sound like the love story she describes? hardly worth hearing. stop writing such a story with your life and write the one you deserve as I decided to do.",40.743615,-73.532696,2015-11-25 23:22:18.146125,2015-11-25 23:22:18.146125,detail page

1864,5326936475,The thing about hookups- response to both posters - w4m,2015-11-22 00:30,/mnh/mis/5326936475.html,mnh,w4m,"","I have no idea what you are both going on bout, because women do like sex, one night stands and getting laid. I have met a few women on CL, and they have even been very attractive and hot. Two were tourists. one was a divorced woman who had no interest in relationships and 3 others were just looking for a huge cock and/or some particular kink. I gave it to them.women like to get laid and to fuck. One of the ladies I was with said she was tired of getting to know a guy only to find out he was below average in bed too late. It makes sense to use CL and get what your looking for and not take a random chance on the guy at the bar being a good lay or whatever else you really want. This whole idea that you have to ""offer something more"" is the same mindset hookers have.. they want to cash in the pussy for a price. I have less respect for women who play that game than the type of woman who has sex for it's own sake. a woman who uses her vagina as some prize that extracts monetary or emotional good from a man is worse than a whore- at least a whore is honest and doesn't mislead you and play with your emotions. that type of women never really loves a man she is with, but merely sees him as a thing to be used. How low is that?I'm all for relationships, and I'd consider a relationship with a woman I met here more than I would some prissy judgemental game player who sees sex as a reward for good behavior or as a way to get goodies- emotional or otherwise.When you count dating sites, apps like tinder etc.. what we are seeing is women being more upfront about sex as an honest vehicle for their enjoyment, on their own terms, and that should be encouraged.

1867,5326904184,just an opinion hookups or sex,2015-11-21 23:18,/lgi/mis/5326904184.html,lgi,sex,"","I wouldn't call them mutually inclusive. I think each individual decides the meaning of sex for themselves. Hookups pretty much says what has been decided. what I think of hookups would sound derogatory, its just not what I decided and if honest consenting adults agree, who's to say. then there are those who try to discover by experimenting. I personally think you are ""wiring"" yourself with experiences you may regret if you don't have the foresight to allow yourself that with an open mind, again, not for me. those who treat it as something too sacred may discover in a long term relationship or union, that ""sex"" will be many things, an expression and celebration of love, assurance and comfort, affirmation if you will during stormy times, then occasionally man or woman has an urge that needs to be satisfied and has the luxury of a willing partner they love, but that night it wont be about love and that's ok. so I think it's not about what sex is, but just declaring for yourself what it will be. I've had the misfortune to see women lose their ""compass"", when it is pleasurable to the point of obsession with just one aspect of life, do anything ,say anything, pretend it is anything for it to continue on. to see that the majority of energy, availability and focus was on sex. to tear herself and the other up over coming to terms with that, and when the other discovers such a thing doesn't want that, there is hell to pay. I respect anyone who is at least honest up front what it means to them and respects the others choice. leverage, just an urge to be satisfied, an act of love or a reward for being what somebody wanted you to be, if its up front, understood, let like minded people find each other. Both arguments I hear it is nothing to do with love, one is urges to be satisfied the other a prize for being a resource to you, to each their own. As for my experience with women, it was sad to see those who discovered too late that for some men it did represent what they had dreamed it should and given up on it..........till. sorry to disappoint but some do ""fuck"" with their heart, get it broken discovering it wasn't love but just the sex for her. What a man can do to a woman when he loves her and her the same, i'll say no thanks to everything else to protect that.",40.725400,-73.516600,2015-11-25 23:25:32.453928,2015-11-25 23:25:32.453928,detail page

Even in the very formation of their claims.Seriously, if you're going to go off on a diatribe like you just did--choose 'safer ground' from which to preach. Rely on more solid examples to support your assertions.Most of your post is a rant against stalkers and harassment. Okay, fine. But you don't know enough about internet law to go around trying to scare people with threats of lawsuit. That's #1.#2, if you're going to take such an intellectual, lordly posture and waggle-your-finger down at the rest of us, you'd better know how to write intelligently. Halfway through your post you descend into pure gibberish. It was overly-wordy to the point of unintelligibility. Learn how to state your points succinctly if you want impact. Less is more. You kept reiterating your gripes--various ways of stating the same premise--and you quickly lost all the force you were hoping for.Finally, this theory of yours (below) is entirely thin. An 'audience' can certainly identify traits in a performer ...regardless of the performance the actor *believe* they provided.  The actor is the least trustworthy authority on what they conveyed with their performance. Audience input is the final --and sole--arbitrator of whether the actor was convincing or not.You can certainly follow the career of an actor and make all sorts of observations about their personality regardless of the roles they take up or the masks they don. It is merely ""actor's conceit"" to believe they are totally submerged in a role by the power or skill in their portrayal. Wrong: The fact that you think you can genuinely ""know"" a woman based upon the roles in entertainment she chooses to consider, e.g. she played a werewolf so she must be a werewolf, she played a bitch, so she must be a bitch, is just plain stupid and downright ignorant of you.It's a darn shame you don't want things hurled in your face, but this weak rationale of yours is not the way to undercut such public castigation.",40.649912,-73.949806,2015-11-30 04:34:52.998363,2015-11-30 04:34:52.998363,Google Places API

In entertainment, when someone takes on the role of a script, it doesn't mean in any way that the actress taking on the role or script is the same person in real life or that you as a complete stranger have the right to know what she is like in real life. That's called her private life. If you're a stranger, you have no right to invade her private life. If you feel entitled to push and provoke in attempts to know her private life, it's called invasion of privacy, a crime punishable by law. Your obsessive actions also suggest coercion and duress.The fact that you think you can genuinely ""know"" a woman based upon the roles in entertainment she chooses to consider, e.g. she played a werewolf so she must be a werewolf, she played a bitch, so she must be a bitch, is just plain stupid and downright ignorant of you.If anyone seems ""shrewish"" to use your choice of word, I'd suggest that you first look at your actions. I doubt that if your disposition and actions have been kind, warm, giving, accepting, generous and understanding, you would have received a ""shrewish"", bad-tempered personality in return.If you've perceived a kind person as bad-tempered, perhaps it's because you have prejudged that person based upon preconceived notions to reflect qualities which are of your life and self, e.g. mean, vicious, cruel, invasive, and then projected such qualities onto her. Perhaps you resent or envy your differences. The bigger and more signficant questions are if you have perceived a woman as ""bad-tempered""why would you contact her again and again as if you're obsessed with her IF you're such a saint?Why would you obsessively be contacting someone with whom you are simply incompatible?Is that not harassment and abuse? Then, how could you expect to be logically received in a warm and open, welcoming manner?Furthermore, the overwhelming implication that guys at this site resent the subject of money as if it's not a basic reality and necessity of life from the moment you wake in the morning to the moment you end your day, a means to freedom and power, and a way to markedly improve your own life and the lives of others, suggests that their mentality, lifestyle and upbringing is something foreign to me, almost like a different language. Everyone in my world is all about the freedom that money provides - making it, investing it, spending it, donating it, spoiling others with it. To have enough money means the good life, to have enough to retire, to have enough to enjoy, to have enough to obtain what you need when you need it, to take things to the next level or improve your situation if it's not what it needs to be, to be able to care for others when they are in need. If you're not this type of guy and I make clear that this is the type of guy I seek, I'm doing you a favor. I'm letting you know off the bat that we're incompatible. Most people and relationship counselors consider differences in how you view money as relevant to basic compatibility. This doesn't mean that we can't perfectly coexist at the site along with our differences. In addition, the choices a woman makes are her business, not yours. All that should matter to you is if by the content of the ad and followup you seem compatible or not. If by the content of the ad you seem clearly incompatible or looking for different things, there's NO legitimate reason to make contact. This is clearly indicated under Prohibited of Terms of Use AND the option to check do not contact me with unsolicited offers. A role, product, or service has more or less value based upon what someone is willing to pay. That which is of the highest value is generally appealing to someone who can appreciate and afford it. Just because you don't see the value or are unable to afford it, doesn't mean everyone lacks the ability or interest.It's the general mentality of certain members of this site in regard to ads placed here that if ""you're not like us"", i.e. discrimination, and we dislike what you represent or how we perceive you, we will abuse you until you have no choice, but to leave, i.e. harassment, both of which are illegal in the eyes of the law. To name call and use incorrect terminology in attempts to demean and disparage a woman, i.e. verbalabuse, although the terms(s) as defined in the English language in the dictionary do(es) not apply, i.e. defamation and libel, makes you seem abusive, immature and dumb, it doesn't make the inapprpriate language apply. The offenders use abusive, vulgar terminology in regard to strictly platonic ads and content which is expressly written as nonsexual, and simply does not apply.I suggest that you be honest with yourself. If you have that much time on your hands to follow around the ads of and reply to someone whom you've implied is blatantly incompatible and bad-tempered, then what is missing from :::your life:::? Why are you not focused on :::your life:::?To be clear, I would have zero reason to pen this post if it wasn't for online stalkers and trolls making contact via cl relay email. I don't have the need to email people with whom I'm uncompatible. I'm focused on my best life. How about you?

I came to your office back in 2007 or so because I was having a dispute with my roommate. You were a free Pro Se attorney there and gave me advice on how to deal with her (in the Resource Room/Help Center, room 404 I believe). I remember you being kind of angry and bossy and impatient, not at me, just in general, like the job was driving you crazy. I could understand, given the circumstances and the ghetto, thuggish crowd you mostly deal with there (on that particular day I saw you, a black man with dreads in the elevator threatened to ""shoot up the place"" because he didn't want to wait on line anymore and you called Security on him... another time I went a 20 something female accused some 70 year old woman of ""flirting with her man"" just because the older lady said excuse me as they formed a queue/line, and the young woman then threatened to beat her up. Ridiculous stuff like that.. You were one of the most intense people I've ever met...You were impeccably dressed in a navy blue suit, a fit white male with dark, dark brown hair and beautiful cheekbones to match intensely blue eyes. There's nothing sexier than a man bossin' a woman around. I need a man like that- one who is 'in charge' and in touch with his masculinity. Naturally dominant, no props needed... Let me stroke that hair and those cheekbones and melt you down... I'm a swf (white), 5 ft 7, 35 years old, with long auburn colored hair, curvy where it counts (back and front), very busty, green eyes.

Are you interested in me? If so, is it full-time? Part-time? Freelance? You do know that those with full-time status receive benefits, right? Part-timers get to attend uninspired meetings in a cheap effort to make them feel like they're included, and the ones who freelance, well, they're just taken advantage of and shit upon.

There are many factors involved in this confusion. Here are a few, listed in no particular order:1) At this point in my life, I'm done with baseless alliances. I want something of substance, whether it be a friendship or more. I'm not sure you're at this same stage.2) There are other people involved - friends and family near and dear to us. Furthering things and subsequently fucking them up fucks those people up, too, probably creating one of those fucking rifts in which people feel as if they must pick fucking sides. That's a lot of fucking pressure not to fuck up.3) I like downers and you like uppers.I'm aware these are all issues that are easily solved by real, face to face communication.

In the being you would sneak me into your place. I would get ready in your bathroom then have you take me into you room. I remember the first time. You FUCK me so hard, I was in love from that moment on. Our best moment ever, and at the top of my list, was the time it was very late, and you wanted me to come over, but your folks was home. I parked across the street from your place, and you had me come in through the back door which lead to your unfinished basement. I remember how dark, dusty and cold it was. We made out on the old leather sofa. Then you got rock hard and made me to blow you. I took a hit of poppers the moment stood up and throw a towel on the floor. You fucked me so hard that I couldn't keep still. You pushed you palm into my mouth to try to quiet me. We broke all our condoms that night, a common theme in our sex affair. I was covered in your sweat and dust. I still get hot thinking about it. The sweetest part, hours later when we were done we split a can of Spite. We hung out a few times after, but then lost contact. I really hope this letter finds you. Sexual we're a match. You were the first person to 1.) Love my look and 2.) Keep up with me in my sex life.

I would never respect how you neglect and treat others. yes I turned every invitation away, to absorb what I knew you would do on this day for someone else. and my instincts were right. next year I will provide thanksgiving for someone who has none, to honor what you are not. so it is, life tangled with you, both of us did nothing. i'm sorry I couldn't find the heart for others this year, your darkness just preyed on my mind knowing exactly what you would be doing and your false best wishes concealing contempt, enjoy your day, I knew what you meant by that before you ever told me. everybody should be miserable just because you are?

I lived on Martha's Vineyard. The connection was strong and it lasted a good 3 weeks. not long, but for the gays of nowadays, perhaps, Maybe!It's taken me sometime to get to a point in life, by dating others and not dating for lengthy periods at all to say, that I think I'm finally getting up in the morning and not thinking of you daily. Everything truly does happen for a reason, sounds kitsch or cliche, but it works. The biggest lesson I've learned in my first few years of my 30's is to always just Trust your gut instincts. A foot in and a foot out, doesn't lead to a relationship, it only leads to doubt. DO I regret leaving? well, Yes! obviously. Not only did I disappoint you but I let myself down. I never gave myself the chance to see where things may have led. In retrospect would I have wanted to stay and keep those last 18 hours? Yes. absolutely. I think it would've solidified a lot more for you to be honest. It's my belief that even though you fight things in your heart and mind, and you can tell yourself NO I'm not ready a million times over....you really don't have a choice. Good, and bad things come when you least expect them. Do I wish things between us were different? not entirely, because I don't think in the grander scheme of things I made a mistake. I do just wish we stayed friends. It's really hard to find someone you can talk to about almost anything and let alone who has a Gilmore Girl DVD collection.

Here's some shared wisdom.If it's not for you, please don't prevent those who are able to be inspired to benefit from it. Thank you. To the person who contacted me to say she? finds it contradictory,it's because life is contradictory. There's no one-size-fits-all, not one reactionor one set of circumstances. There's only general wisdom you gain from life and experience.Just because you claim to not find the wisdom useful based upon your own miserable, angry self,doesn't mean others won't find the info enlightening and uplifting given their own experiences.We do not all lead the same life or see it through the same set of eyes. This should be obvious.Furthermore, circumstances in regard to gen'l online intertaction at this site do not applyto people in general in their own circle of life. Just because you relate to being abused and find it perfectly sound and natural, doesn't make it the case for everyone else. Some people have more respect for themselves and others and believe they are worthy of betterwhether they come from a hard life or not. Just because you're hardened and guarded and see that as ""normal"" doesn't make it the reality for everyone else. Some people see purity and kindness as freedom and anger and pain as a prison of your own making. That's a fact, not a judgment. The point of general wisdom is that you apply it where it suits you, where it provides you peaceand understanding, not to suggest that a wisdom applies to each and every situation in life. If you've interpreted the list to say that it applies to each and every situation and each and every person, then it looks like you're the one who needs an education. More importantly, you really shouldn't be so angry, especially on a holiday which is about gratitude. It's a sin. Yes, that's my opinion. It's my post! 1) Make peace with your pastso it won't screw up the present.2) Time healsalmost everything.Give it time.Or make peacewith yourselfto let it go.You're doing it for yourselfnot for the one's who hurt you.3) Don't compareyour life to othersand don't judge others.You have no ideawhat their journey is about.There are so many anonymous CL-ershere who are so quick to judge ratherthan accept that we are just different.If they allowed others to be, otherswouldn't have the need to return a taste of their own medicine. What do not judge is sayingis live and let live.If you are not judging in the first place,you won't receive it back.A person can be focused on her own lifeand there are strangers who seek to givetheir two cents and butt into it where itwas never requested. That's what promptsan article such as this one. 4) You can't go through lifebelieving that everyonewill understand you,relate to you,or even accept you.You can only voice your opinion.The difference between placing an ad and responding to an email is that placing an ad says you decide whether you wish to open it and read it,but if it's not for you, no problem skip it.Find something which works for you.An email suggests that you're on the same pageor why would you be bothering to email in the first place?So then when someone opens an email and it was unsolicitedand doesn't respect the request of what was asked, then it's judgment.it's alos in violation of TOU.What you say,how you feel,what you believe,what you haveDo not allowjudgment from othersto stop you from being you(if what you are doing is notcausing harm to anyone). 5) What others think of youis none of your business(so there is no point to email strangers when their ad does not resonate with you).6) Never stop believing in hope.Miracles happen everyday.7) The less you respond to negative people,the more peaceful your life will become.(When you speak out it's an ablution for yourselfand those who understand you). 8) A negative mindwill never give you a positive life.(People email others here even if they have nothing nice to saywhen it makes no rational sense to anyone).9) Perpetual optimismis a force multiplier.(Try kindness).10) If you keep focusing on what you fear,that's exactly where you'll end up.Learn to separate the facts from the pain.Be aware of the difference.11) Remember, it's not the conditions,but the decisions which determine our lives.Trust actions; words may deceive you.13) Silence is the best reply to a fool.14) The way of the miracle worker isto see all human behavioras one of two things,loveor a callto love.People who are in pain deliver pain.You can't fix other's problemsif it harms you in the process.Deception drains life energy.Toxicity poisons the soul.Accept situations whichare transparent and simple.If you ask direct questions,and don't receive direct answers,accept that the person is troubledand you will be a vessel for that painfor as long as you choose to stick around.15) One smile can start a friendship.One word can end a fight.One look can save a relationship.One person can change your life.It all depends on who is on the receiving end.Some people demand more of youthan you're able to giveor can afford to lose.By the time they come around,if they ever do,you no longer want what you had acceptedwhen it was first offered.Not everyone sees giving as receiving.You'll definitely feel it when someonehas trouble being pure in his giving.Your interaction will be riddled with confusionbecause the interaction is less than honest.Don't force it. Accept that what you see is the truthand release it rather than apply your energy hopingthat it's something positive.If you're receiving pain and confusion, believe it.If you're receiving kindness, warmth and generosity, believe it.Not everyone will be on your vibrational level.If you stick around negative energy long enoughit will adversely affect your own.Good people tend to be trusting because they are trustworthy.Online this can be a disaster if you run into one of many online fakeswho says one thing, but does another. He will create an image in orderto bait or interest you, but you will quickly learn that he doesn't keep his word.That's how you instantly know they're fake. Another way is that they'll attemptto place you on the defensive for their own bad behavior. I have a friend whodid his thesis on the subject of what is real and the fake profiles which exist online.That's just how prevalent it is. Beware.16) The way of the Universeand *its goodness*stills you,enlightens you,energizes you,andcalms you.Purity and goodnessdo notdeceive,condemn,confuseor use defense mechanismsto then blame youfor the energy they brought to the table.You may just be there in stillness taking it all in.Feeling drained and confused should be an instant warning.Honest communications and actions are not difficult to understand.Manpulative and malicious actions will confuse you if that's not of you.17) When someoneshows you who he is,believe him the first time.Do not grant repeated chancesto someone who has already failed you.It's far easier to work on yourselfthan to change another who hasn't asked.18) I heard earlier today that we speakand envision ""men"", but many people actmore like animals devoid of any self-controlor filter or care in regard to others,or deference to any religious figure or poweror spirit greater than themselves.There's no shame, guilt or fear.If you see the world as one way,and another operates on or was raised with opposite principles,it will be a challenge to understand or relate to one another.19) Should you ever find yourselfthe victim of another'sbitterness,smallnessor insecurities,things could be worse;YOU could be them.20) You can't reach for anything newif your hands and heartare laden with yesterday's junk.Let it go.21) The best thing about your past is thatit shows you what not to bring into the future.The people with whomyou choose to surround yourselfinfluence youwhether you like it or not.Choose wisely.22) Great minds discuss ideas;average minds discuss events;small minds discuss people.23) Let therefinement andimprovementof your own life,keep you fulfilledso that you haveno time to criticize others.24) If you expect the worldto be fair to youbecause you are fair,then you're fooling yourself.It's like expectingthe lion not to eat you,because you did not eat them.Conversely, it is ethical people who follow ethical principles,such as ""Do unto others as you'd have done unto you.""25) It's not what you look at that matters,it's what you choose to see.If it doesn't work for you,walk away.Your soul will never win if you allowa poisoned mind to damage your heart.26) If people live with criticism,they learn to condemn.If they live with hostility,they learn to fight.If they live with fear,they learn to be apprehensive.If they live with pity,they learn to feel sorry for themselves.If they live with ridicule,they learn to feel shy.If they live with jealousy,they learn to feel envious.If they live with encouragement,they learn confidence.If they live with praise,they learn appreciation.If they live with acceptance,they learn to love.If they live with sharing,they learn generosity.If they live with honesty,they learn truthfulness.If they live with kindnessand consideration,they learn respect.If they live with security,they learn to have faithin themselvesand in those around them.If they live with friendliness,they learn that the worldis a nice placein which to live.27) As you rise with the morning sun,think what a precious privilege it isto be alive -to breathe,to think,to enjoy,to love.28) Value your own life and the lives of others.29) Be thankful.Happy Thanksgiving.Wishing You Many Blessingsand the Awareness to See Them.",40.7127837,-74.0059413,2015-11-30 04:40:41.287072,2015-11-30 04:40:41.287072,Google Places API

Maybe I'm a fool to feel it's knot over with the two of us as I hold on to that hope and faith that love does not fade when it's true love and that my loved one has my heart not willing to let go.

Even in the very formation of their claims.Seriously, if you're going to go off on a diatribe like you just did--choose 'safer ground' from which to preach. Rely on more solid examples to support your assertions.Most of your post is a rant against stalkers and harassment. Okay, fine. But you don't know enough about internet law to go around trying to scare people with threats of lawsuit. That's #1.#2, if you're going to take such an intellectual, lordly posture and waggle-your-finger down at the rest of us, you'd better know how to write intelligently. Halfway through your post you descend into pure gibberish. It was overly-wordy to the point of unintelligibility. Learn how to state your points succinctly if you want impact. Less is more. You kept reiterating your gripes--various ways of stating the same premise--and you quickly lost all the force you were hoping for.Finally, this theory of yours (below) is entirely thin. An 'audience' can certainly identify traits in a performer ...regardless of the performance the actor *believe* they provided.  The actor is the least trustworthy authority on what they conveyed with their performance. Audience input is the final --and sole--arbitrator of whether the actor was convincing or not.You can certainly follow the career of an actor and make all sorts of observations about their personality regardless of the roles they take up or the masks they don. It is merely ""actor's conceit"" to believe they are totally submerged in a role by the power or skill in their portrayal. Wrong: The fact that you think you can genuinely ""know"" a woman based upon the roles in entertainment she chooses to consider, e.g. she played a werewolf so she must be a werewolf, she played a bitch, so she must be a bitch, is just plain stupid and downright ignorant of you.It's a darn shame you don't want things hurled in your face, but this weak rationale of yours is not the way to undercut such public castigation.","","",2015-11-30 04:48:56.42738,2015-11-30 04:48:56.42738,detail page

In entertainment, when someone takes on the role of a script, it doesn't mean in any way that the actress taking on the role or script is the same person in real life or that you as a complete stranger have the right to know what she is like in real life. That's called her private life. If you're a stranger, you have no right to invade her private life. If you feel entitled to push and provoke in attempts to know her private life, it's called invasion of privacy, a crime punishable by law. Your obsessive actions also suggest coercion and duress.The fact that you think you can genuinely ""know"" a woman based upon the roles in entertainment she chooses to consider, e.g. she played a werewolf so she must be a werewolf, she played a bitch, so she must be a bitch, is just plain stupid and downright ignorant of you.If anyone seems ""shrewish"" to use your choice of word, I'd suggest that you first look at your actions. I doubt that if your disposition and actions have been kind, warm, giving, accepting, generous and understanding, you would have received a ""shrewish"", bad-tempered personality in return.If you've perceived a kind person as bad-tempered, perhaps it's because you have prejudged that person based upon preconceived notions to reflect qualities which are of your life and self, e.g. mean, vicious, cruel, invasive, and then projected such qualities onto her. Perhaps you resent or envy your differences. The bigger and more signficant questions are if you have perceived a woman as ""bad-tempered""why would you contact her again and again as if you're obsessed with her IF you're such a saint?Why would you obsessively be contacting someone with whom you are simply incompatible?Is that not harassment and abuse? Then, how could you expect to be logically received in a warm and open, welcoming manner?Furthermore, the overwhelming implication that guys at this site resent the subject of money as if it's not a basic reality and necessity of life from the moment you wake in the morning to the moment you end your day, a means to freedom and power, and a way to markedly improve your own life and the lives of others, suggests that their mentality, lifestyle and upbringing is something foreign to me, almost like a different language. Everyone in my world is all about the freedom that money provides - making it, investing it, spending it, donating it, spoiling others with it. To have enough money means the good life, to have enough to retire, to have enough to enjoy, to have enough to obtain what you need when you need it, to take things to the next level or improve your situation if it's not what it needs to be, to be able to care for others when they are in need. If you're not this type of guy and I make clear that this is the type of guy I seek, I'm doing you a favor. I'm letting you know off the bat that we're incompatible. Most people and relationship counselors consider differences in how you view money as relevant to basic compatibility. This doesn't mean that we can't perfectly coexist at the site along with our differences. In addition, the choices a woman makes are her business, not yours. All that should matter to you is if by the content of the ad and followup you seem compatible or not. If by the content of the ad you seem clearly incompatible or looking for different things, there's NO legitimate reason to make contact. This is clearly indicated under Prohibited of Terms of Use AND the option to check do not contact me with unsolicited offers. A role, product, or service has more or less value based upon what someone is willing to pay. That which is of the highest value is generally appealing to someone who can appreciate and afford it. Just because you don't see the value or are unable to afford it, doesn't mean everyone lacks the ability or interest.It's the general mentality of certain members of this site in regard to ads placed here that if ""you're not like us"", i.e. discrimination, and we dislike what you represent or how we perceive you, we will abuse you until you have no choice, but to leave, i.e. harassment, both of which are illegal in the eyes of the law. To name call and use incorrect terminology in attempts to demean and disparage a woman, i.e. verbalabuse, although the terms(s) as defined in the English language in the dictionary do(es) not apply, i.e. defamation and libel, makes you seem abusive, immature and dumb, it doesn't make the inapprpriate language apply. The offenders use abusive, vulgar terminology in regard to strictly platonic ads and content which is expressly written as nonsexual, and simply does not apply.I suggest that you be honest with yourself. If you have that much time on your hands to follow around the ads of and reply to someone whom you've implied is blatantly incompatible and bad-tempered, then what is missing from :::your life:::? Why are you not focused on :::your life:::?To be clear, I would have zero reason to pen this post if it wasn't for online stalkers and trolls making contact via cl relay email. I don't have the need to email people with whom I'm uncompatible. I'm focused on my best life. How about you?

Considering you're the audience to be reading this, I first wanted to acknowledge and greet you. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to pretend you don't exist, and proceed to write the following as if the only eyes to be laid on it are those of the person in question, which we've already established won't happen.Not everything in life needs to have a superficial meaning, so don't look for one.Here goes:I can't read you. Are you interested in me? If so, is it full-time? Part-time? Freelance? You do know that those with full-time status receive benefits, right? Part-timers get to attend uninspired meetings in a cheap effort to make them feel like they're included, and the ones who freelance, well, they're just taken advantage of and shit upon. I'm comfortable with you in any role - I just need to know which one you prefer, as I can then move to fill the other positions.**Please take note, the above doesn't necessarily pertain to a romantic relationship. It's all-encompassing.In fairness to you, I probably don't make the effort to read you, nor do I allow myself to be read. The reason for this isn't because I view this as a game, but because I'm not sure of how to advance, and therefore shy away from a situation in which I'd have to do so. There are many factors involved in this confusion. Here are a few, listed in no particular order:1) At this point in my life, I'm done with baseless alliances. I want something of substance, whether it be a friendship or more. I'm not sure you're at this same stage.2) There are other people involved - friends and family near and dear to us. Furthering things and subsequently fucking them up fucks those people up, too, probably creating one of those fucking rifts in which people feel as if they must pick fucking sides. That's a lot of fucking pressure not to fuck up.3) I like downers and you like uppers.I'm aware these are all issues that are easily solved by real, face to face communication.

I've always been wired that way, never understood the concept of casual relationships. Not saying that I'm expecting us to hit it off right away, only saying that my approach for meeting someone is always about whether we could fit as life partners. I'm saying I believe 1 + 1 = 3. I'm putting this ad out there in the internet ether, wondering if something tangible will emerge out of the primordial soup. I'm a very classic and total ENFJ. My perfect dinosaur would be someone late 20s to early 30s. Asian, Indian (yes, I know technically Indians are Asian), Guyanese, or Caucasian. Someone who is open minded, laid back, emotionally stable, who absolutely believes in monogamy. Someone who is comfortable in their own skin, down-to-earth, hilarious, thoughtful, nostalgic, and is mostly an open book. Oh and vital: be young at heart. Basically, I'm looking for the female version of myself. As for myself, I'm well put together in life, and every cell of my being is comprised of good-natured charm.

Everything truly does happen for a reason, sounds kitsch or cliche, but it works. The biggest lesson I've learned in my first few years of my 30's is to always just Trust your gut instincts. A foot in and a foot out, doesn't lead to a relationship, it only leads to doubt. DO I regret leaving? well, Yes! obviously. Not only did I disappoint you but I let myself down. I never gave myself the chance to see where things may have led. In retrospect would I have wanted to stay and keep those last 18 hours? Yes. absolutely. I think it would've solidified a lot more for you to be honest. It's my belief that even though you fight things in your heart and mind, and you can tell yourself NO I'm not ready a million times over....you really don't have a choice. Good, and bad things come when you least expect them. Do I wish things between us were different? not entirely, because I don't think in the grander scheme of things I made a mistake. I do just wish we stayed friends. It's really hard to find someone you can talk to about almost anything and let alone who has a Gilmore Girl DVD collection.

Here's some shared wisdom.If it's not for you, please don't prevent those who are able to be inspired to benefit from it. Thank you. To the person who contacted me to say she? finds it contradictory,it's because life is contradictory. There's no one-size-fits-all, not one reactionor one set of circumstances. There's only general wisdom you gain from life and experience.Just because you claim to not find the wisdom useful based upon your own miserable, angry self,doesn't mean others won't find the info enlightening and uplifting given their own experiences.We do not all lead the same life or see it through the same set of eyes. This should be obvious.Furthermore, circumstances in regard to gen'l online intertaction at this site do not applyto people in general in their own circle of life. Just because you relate to being abused and find it perfectly sound and natural, doesn't make it the case for everyone else. Some people have more respect for themselves and others and believe they are worthy of betterwhether they come from a hard life or not. Just because you're hardened and guarded and see that as ""normal"" doesn't make it the reality for everyone else. Some people see purity and kindness as freedom and anger and pain as a prison of your own making. That's a fact, not a judgment. The point of general wisdom is that you apply it where it suits you, where it provides you peaceand understanding, not to suggest that a wisdom applies to each and every situation in life. If you've interpreted the list to say that it applies to each and every situation and each and every person, then it looks like you're the one who needs an education. More importantly, you really shouldn't be so angry, especially on a holiday which is about gratitude. It's a sin. Yes, that's my opinion. It's my post! 1) Make peace with your pastso it won't screw up the present.2) Time healsalmost everything.Give it time.Or make peacewith yourselfto let it go.You're doing it for yourselfnot for the one's who hurt you.3) Don't compareyour life to othersand don't judge others.You have no ideawhat their journey is about.There are so many anonymous CL-ershere who are so quick to judge ratherthan accept that we are just different.If they allowed others to be, otherswouldn't have the need to return a taste of their own medicine. What do not judge is sayingis live and let live.If you are not judging in the first place,you won't receive it back.A person can be focused on her own lifeand there are strangers who seek to givetheir two cents and butt into it where itwas never requested. That's what promptsan article such as this one. 4) You can't go through lifebelieving that everyonewill understand you,relate to you,or even accept you.You can only voice your opinion.The difference between placing an ad and responding to an email is that placing an ad says you decide whether you wish to open it and read it,but if it's not for you, no problem skip it.Find something which works for you.An email suggests that you're on the same pageor why would you be bothering to email in the first place?So then when someone opens an email and it was unsolicitedand doesn't respect the request of what was asked, then it's judgment.it's alos in violation of TOU.What you say,how you feel,what you believe,what you haveDo not allowjudgment from othersto stop you from being you(if what you are doing is notcausing harm to anyone). 5) What others think of youis none of your business(so there is no point to email strangers when their ad does not resonate with you).6) Never stop believing in hope.Miracles happen everyday.7) The less you respond to negative people,the more peaceful your life will become.(When you speak out it's an ablution for yourselfand those who understand you). 8) A negative mindwill never give you a positive life.(People email others here even if they have nothing nice to saywhen it makes no rational sense to anyone).9) Perpetual optimismis a force multiplier.(Try kindness).10) If you keep focusing on what you fear,that's exactly where you'll end up.Learn to separate the facts from the pain.Be aware of the difference.11) Remember, it's not the conditions,but the decisions which determine our lives.Trust actions; words may deceive you.13) Silence is the best reply to a fool.14) The way of the miracle worker isto see all human behavioras one of two things,loveor a callto love.People who are in pain deliver pain.You can't fix other's problemsif it harms you in the process.Deception drains life energy.Toxicity poisons the soul.Accept situations whichare transparent and simple.If you ask direct questions,and don't receive direct answers,accept that the person is troubledand you will be a vessel for that painfor as long as you choose to stick around.15) One smile can start a friendship.One word can end a fight.One look can save a relationship.One person can change your life.It all depends on who is on the receiving end.Some people demand more of youthan you're able to giveor can afford to lose.By the time they come around,if they ever do,you no longer want what you had acceptedwhen it was first offered.Not everyone sees giving as receiving.You'll definitely feel it when someonehas trouble being pure in his giving.Your interaction will be riddled with confusionbecause the interaction is less than honest.Don't force it. Accept that what you see is the truthand release it rather than apply your energy hopingthat it's something positive.If you're receiving pain and confusion, believe it.If you're receiving kindness, warmth and generosity, believe it.Not everyone will be on your vibrational level.If you stick around negative energy long enoughit will adversely affect your own.Good people tend to be trusting because they are trustworthy.Online this can be a disaster if you run into one of many online fakeswho says one thing, but does another. He will create an image in orderto bait or interest you, but you will quickly learn that he doesn't keep his word.That's how you instantly know they're fake. Another way is that they'll attemptto place you on the defensive for their own bad behavior. I have a friend whodid his thesis on the subject of what is real and the fake profiles which exist online.That's just how prevalent it is. Beware.16) The way of the Universeand *its goodness*stills you,enlightens you,energizes you,andcalms you.Purity and goodnessdo notdeceive,condemn,confuseor use defense mechanismsto then blame youfor the energy they brought to the table.You may just be there in stillness taking it all in.Feeling drained and confused should be an instant warning.Honest communications and actions are not difficult to understand.Manpulative and malicious actions will confuse you if that's not of you.17) When someoneshows you who he is,believe him the first time.Do not grant repeated chancesto someone who has already failed you.It's far easier to work on yourselfthan to change another who hasn't asked.18) I heard earlier today that we speakand envision ""men"", but many people actmore like animals devoid of any self-controlor filter or care in regard to others,or deference to any religious figure or poweror spirit greater than themselves.There's no shame, guilt or fear.If you see the world as one way,and another operates on or was raised with opposite principles,it will be a challenge to understand or relate to one another.19) Should you ever find yourselfthe victim of another'sbitterness,smallnessor insecurities,things could be worse;YOU could be them.20) You can't reach for anything newif your hands and heartare laden with yesterday's junk.Let it go.21) The best thing about your past is thatit shows you what not to bring into the future.The people with whomyou choose to surround yourselfinfluence youwhether you like it or not.Choose wisely.22) Great minds discuss ideas;average minds discuss events;small minds discuss people.23) Let therefinement andimprovementof your own life,keep you fulfilledso that you haveno time to criticize others.24) If you expect the worldto be fair to youbecause you are fair,then you're fooling yourself.It's like expectingthe lion not to eat you,because you did not eat them.Conversely, it is ethical people who follow ethical principles,such as ""Do unto others as you'd have done unto you.""25) It's not what you look at that matters,it's what you choose to see.If it doesn't work for you,walk away.Your soul will never win if you allowa poisoned mind to damage your heart.26) If people live with criticism,they learn to condemn.If they live with hostility,they learn to fight.If they live with fear,they learn to be apprehensive.If they live with pity,they learn to feel sorry for themselves.If they live with ridicule,they learn to feel shy.If they live with jealousy,they learn to feel envious.If they live with encouragement,they learn confidence.If they live with praise,they learn appreciation.If they live with acceptance,they learn to love.If they live with sharing,they learn generosity.If they live with honesty,they learn truthfulness.If they live with kindnessand consideration,they learn respect.If they live with security,they learn to have faithin themselvesand in those around them.If they live with friendliness,they learn that the worldis a nice placein which to live.27) As you rise with the morning sun,think what a precious privilege it isto be alive -to breathe,to think,to enjoy,to love.28) Value your own life and the lives of others.29) Be thankful.Happy Thanksgiving.Wishing You Many Blessingsand the Awareness to See Them.","","",2015-11-30 04:53:18.255487,2015-11-30 04:53:18.255487,detail page

Idc if it's a fantasy or what ever the situation is. My heart has so much love. And this love belongs to you. Claim your prize lol. Happy thanksgiving I do wish the absolute best for you and your loved ones. And ummm I so desperately want to be one of those loved ones. Anyway Michele you are so beautiful imagine how beautiful you are to me as love= Michele. I would need so much help if you don't love me. Without you telling me the truth my life will be one big question with every thought hurtful as I was deeply in love with you and your smile and your cute nose. I know your smart strong willed stubborn as hell. Specially to me. But you know my life revolves around you. You my friend had my life on pause since 97. I had no thoughts of my future cause you were my stepping stone for my future. Maybe your right I am obsessed and dillisional and displayed stalking behavior but I need to see talk. To you as you are such a big part of it. How do I tell myself Michele wants nothing and will want nothing to ever do with you. When thoughts cross your mind there's no smile? There's no love felt from your heart to me. Missed loved is what you are. Let's just have the loved there. May your first bite of thanksgiving dinner bring a smile to your face from a happy imagine/ thought of terry. Thinking of you. It's impossible not to. You take 95% of my energy. And yes I have no plan. I need you to say hi then we could plan such a life. Maybe I'm a fool to feel it's knot over with the two of us as I hold on to that hope and faith that love does not fade when it's true love and that my loved one has my heart not willing to let go. Maybe being a cancer fucked me on this one as I can't let go of you. You mean to much to terry. He wants to kiss you. Brief words in between but kissing you is something I want so bad in this lifetime. K. No more Rampling or confessing how much I love you. Or how much I hurt. Just want you to know this heart has love for you. Has held wants to share. I love you. Well my heart loves you. I upset at you lol.

As you were near my table I was with a customer, fumbling over my words, feeling your presence around me. My body became nervous, and before I knew it you left. I watched you check out and exit. I thought I saw you glance back at me as you left. I wonder, was that connection two-sided?

""He doesn'ttouch me!"" ""I don't think he cares!"" ""I want to leave but I have nowhereto go!"" ""If I told him I'm in love with you he'd kick me out of thehouse! You don't want me to be homeless, do you?""And now even on your wedding day or on your honeymoon if he were to ask,""So you never slept with him?"" You would say, ""No! he's just a friend! He might have wanted to but I told him I was already in a relationshipwith you!"" Or some such lying thing. . .You and I know the truth, and that makes your wedding a lie.

I'm 32 years old and the only thing I'm missing is someone to share it with. Maybe I'll find that person here?I tend to be attracted to someone who has the same sort of personality and who is pretty laid back.It's tough to date with this disability though, I feel like that's an automatic dealbreaker for most people. Also, please no replies with words of encouragement- I mean, I'll get your email, and I'll be like ""Yesssh!"" and then I open it, and it turns out to be a message like from Hallmark, ya know?

Except that I found myself unable to follow through, once again. At the time I did believe those things in totality. Still not sure what I believe. Nothing about you is solid in my mind. That is partly your fault. You rarely allowed me in. When two separate people with no knowledge of each other, opine pretty much the exact same things, you stop trusting your own (already proven flawed) instincts and give in to what you must believe is the truth.Life went on. I thought about you daily but had good control. A fair amount of time, never even came close to breaking. But.....That day grew nearer and I asked myself why the fuck am I noticing? I'm past it. Sure. I broke. I'm not sorry for what I said. You soundly professed your love for me, made me believe it in my soul, yet often treated me like I was not important to you. I'm also not convinced of it's truth. As mentioned, its all a blur, nothing concrete, weird for my type of brain. Some of it is probably true, some not. Idk.I know I still love you and hope your happy. Such hypocrisy. I've proven myself to be one. I'm ok with that. Love does weird shit to people.

But I am looking for something physical, because I typically have sex 6 times a year--and that doesn't work for me. I miss having intense physical romance with the women of NYC. Black, White, Asian, Hispanic... Your are all queens. I'm looking for something discreet and steady. Starts simple and innocent, but grows into a weekly thing. I'm looking for someone I can fuck. And fuck well. And in doing so, I need to know you a bit. Learn your ins and outs. I need to know if you want to be on top, or if you'd rather be bent over, while I take you from behind... Kissing you, as I feel the air leave your mouth. As my cock is making your body do things you can't control. I am fit. Could stand to lose 10 lbs, but not fat. I am a bit hairy, but some of you like that. ;) I'm 35, and have short hair with a beard. Again, I'm looking for someone who wants a side fling. We can't be more than that, but I promise to look after you and treat you right. I'm white, but I love all colors of the rainbow. No age is off limits, depending on who you are.

I was wondering if after all these drinks you'd like to meet to go over everything I've done in the past 12 hours. I'm writing to extend my sincerest apologizes to most everyone who was in Bushwick last night (excluding the man who jerks off in the window across the street. You're gross and I meant it). I will keep this brief and candid so as not to waste anymore of your life. I am a monster. Some might say I reached fire monster status last night. Few have seen and most who have don't remain my friend in real life or on the internets. Where do I begin? Maybe it was you who I offended by yelling at your for no reason at all. I'm sorry. Or maybe it was the awkward conversation I forced you to have with me when all you wanted to do was drink your whiskey and enjoy some pop corn. I'm sorry. Or maybe it was your senses I offended by wearing a sleep mask on my head all night. I'm sorry! Or was it that I insisted you consume cupcakes you had no desire to eat? Sorry. Or the sad songs I made you endure again and again while I cried into my vodka soda leaning against the jukebox barring anyone from playing anything else. Ugh. Sorry. Or was it the trip to hospital you had to take after your ears started bleeding due to my horrendous non-stop ""singing."" Look, I can't fix any of it (especially the hospital trip -- insurance, ya know?) but I am so sorry. I can't take any of it back. I don't get a do-over. But please take some comfort in knowing I hate myself as much as you do. Probably more. I will recluse myself into my apartment like the rabid bear that I am. I will force myself into a life of seclusion and order bad neighborhood takeout (it's actually mostly all really bad. I know you have no reason to trust me, but just trust me on this one). Thank you for celebrating my birthday with me even it that was most definitely not your intention, and also for not throwing me into oncoming traffic. I'm so sorry.

Due to some very unfortunate circumstances at the time we had a serious falling out, but my heart was still smitten with my adoring love of you, your creativity, talent, intelligence as well as humor. When we were together there was clearly a magic that you recognized and even paid tribute to in a wonderful CD you made. We laughed together and discovered many aspects of each other that only close friends could discover. I regret the way things ended and want to see if you are open to trying to get a relationship off to a better start having had the years pass and each of us assuming a different level of maturity. If this is about you please let me know by listing the CD title in your response. I hope you see this so that we can mend fences and begin to enjoy each others company again so we can move mountains as a couple.",40.726042,-73.993567,2015-12-07 01:52:02.338272,2015-12-07 01:52:02.338272,Google Places API

Sunny with a chilled breeze that is making my scarf hard to handle in the wind. Its quite funny and i cant help but find this dance with the wind amusing so i take the lead of the wind a draw my scarf around me into a spin that is harmoniously sychronized with the tune in my head, i smile at the girl who just witnessed my mini performance dance as she passed me by. I smile back a shy smile since i had not realized that someone was watching. I chuckle a bit as i continue on my walk and thats when i notice that there is a commotion at the doorway to the deli infront of me, two guys are in a rather heated argument about something and i watch them while hoping that they do not get physical and as my attention is diverted towards the scene to my left, i bump into you, like me you too were rather distracted but not by the commotion but rather by your phone, you are trying to make some last minute plans with your director and telling him that you got help up at your apartment settling some misunderstanding with your roommate and that you would be there as soon as you can.. 15 minutes at most, and before you can send the text we collide, your phone flies out of your hand and smashes to the ground, causing the screen to crack and go black. My face is in shock as i earnestly try to apologize while you speechlessly are picking up the phone from the ground, your day just turned from bad to worse and this is not how i wish to have had my first introduction however the moment you look at me to diamiss my apologies since there isnt much either of us can do, you pause a moment as our eyes engage, in that brief moment it felt like a static bolt of charged energy went through my spine, im not sure what you felt exactly but i know you too felt somehing since you had to shake yourself out of this magnetic electric momentary lock in, it felt as though we had mysteriously opened up an psychicly locked door that held such immensity of emotional information that it took unexpectedly longer that usual for our consciousness to download it all. After this lag in our time, you simply smiled an awkward confused half-smile since you were still trying to wrap your mind around what you just felt (all worries about your phone had disappeared until you glanced down at your hand to see your broken phone) i saw you notice and that brought me back into reality, i immediately apologized and asked how could i fix this for you. You assured me it is no big deal, and that it would be okay. I still felt terrible so i gave you my card and wrote down my personal number on the back for you if in case i could be of any sort of assistance just give me a call. This reminded you that you had to run to your meeting with the director and you checked your watch to see that you are already 20 minutes late for your dance rehearsal. You hurriedly thanked me and rushed off as i stood there and watched you quickly walk north towards uptown, within 15 seconds you turned back to look at me and smiled a casual smile at seeing me standing there still. And then i started walking away. I couldnt help but smile thinking of this unusual encounter we just had as i walked away and suddenly the wind hit me and i knew i had to turn around, out of impulse i turned and you too had turned and for a moment we just looked into each others eyes in silence, knowing for the first time that we are meant to be.The taxi driver that you had asked for was honking for your attention and you had to get in however as the taxi drove off you and i continued to look into each others eyes with an irresistible aching fire that just got ignited. I even took a few steps towards your taxi but you were already on your way. I would not hear from you... and life would go on while every now and then i would suddenly wake up in the middle of the night, thinking about you. The memory of your eyes and the depth of emotion i felt in that moment will continue to haunt me for the next few months. A call came from berlin and i had to visit there to scope out a spot for a performance so i packed my bags and planned a trip to visit Berlin. When walking over the bridge i would see you sitting at a cafe across the small river. I would not be able to believe my eyes and thought it surely must be a hallucination but regardless i could not afford to lose you twice, i could not imagine why you would be here in berlin but it did not matter, i ran as fast as i could to the cafe only to find that you are not there anymore, though your check is still on the table so i know you were not a hallucination and that you could not have gone far, i look around me in frantic sweeps and catch the back of your head wrapped in a red beige and black patterned scarf that i saw you wearing. I run after you as you are turning the corner. I find you at the flower shop smelling a bunch of yellow daffodils and i am certain in my heart that it is you. I run up to you and touch your shoulder, you turn surprised to meet my eyes, you take off your shades and stunned to see the recognition in my eyes, you ask if we have met before. I say yes! Remember, in new york, you had a d major dance rehersal to run to and we bumped into each other and that your phone broke and i gave you my card and we shared this moment of intimate connection... you listen very carefully and ask me what colored shirt were you wearing that day. What? Um, let me think.. a green dress shirt, yeah it was silky and had a nice sheen, why? As i inquire, i see tears pooling up in your eyes and im even more confused now, i softly touch your shoulder to comfort you and ask you whats wrong, is everything okay? You shake your head and take a moment to regain your composure and then say that it was your twin sister who had passed away 5 years ago in a taxi accident on the way to her final rehersal for a dance performance at the Carnegie hall. That cant be! I tell you that this just happened less than 5 months ago! You simply look into my eyes and i see clearly the eyes i had seen that morning and realize i was meant to find you and your sister was introducing me to you that morning on the streets of new york. I look into your eyes one more time and simply hug you tight into my chest, you seem confused at first but then you let go and melt into my chest and hug me back as we stand surrounded by daffodils connected together in a quiet electric embrace.-Ishk",40.727934,-73.994722,2015-12-07 01:52:06.942743,2015-12-07 01:52:06.942743,detail page

I was 22, wearing black boots, ripped jeans, black knitted hat, and a navy blue coat with gold buttons. I was walking by while holding a man's hand and looked over at you to my right. We made eye contact and you seemed to be a bit enchanted. There was a connection to be had in that moment. Perhaps it was merely superficial as I recall you being quite handsome, but now and then I wonder. You did not seem like the type who browses the missed connections, let alone 3 years later, but I suppose it's worth a try. I think that maybe you like the rain because you were sitting outside conversing instead of hiding inside like most people. NYC has always been magical for me and perhaps that magic will serve me now. Part of me feels like I am just chattering on into the endless void that is time and should not even bother posting this.

And while I was doing the zombie thing of playing a semi-mindless game on my smart phone to pass the time, I cannot recall which stop you got on. But as the doors opened and people started to file in seats were being taken up, so I lifted my bag to be polite and continued on in zombie like fashion. You and your friend entered the train having a stirring debate, you sat down next to me and your friend sat down in front of me, and continued your debate.While it certainly wasn't the most furious of debates that I've been privy to while on public transportation, you and your friend were exchanging points on the topic. Going back and forth it seemed that for the most part you were both at an impasse as to how to get the other one to stand in the other's shoes and see the point from that perspective. There was a lull in the conversation and you turned to me and apologized. For what, I'm not quite sure; as if this was possibly the worst thing that could happen to a commuter on the MTA. I, stumbling in response, realized that you were actually addressing me. I commented back that I didn't really mind at all. And while I was pretending not to listen, it piqued my curiosity that you would apologize pinning me in the corner while you and your friend carried on.So now I'm most definitely listening to your debate, still focusing my eyes on my phone, I was also trying to figure out if I should interject my own opinion. But I only had a few more stops to go and my brain certainly wasn't up to the task of switching out of zombie mode. I listened for a few more moments and then my stop came: Clinton - Washington Ave. You said good luck, I responded in kind and even chuckled at the thought that you were wishing me luck, and exited the train. Got a little disoriented as to which way I should actually exit the station, but once I got my bearings I looked back in the window and you were glancing at me. I gave a little grin and trotted up the stairs.But alas the buzzing in my brain won't stop thinking about what could have happened if I had a few more stops to go. Or if I had mustered up a good enough question to enter into the foray. All these ""what ifs"" have led me here. Certainly not my best bet for a second chance, but one never knows.

I had just stepped into the elevator and was turning around when you ran in. Our bodies were inches away. We made eye contact for a brief moment, and we were both struck. Your eyes flashed and a silly half grin lit up your face. My heart skipped a beat. My coworkers were chatting on about empty things...I wasn't interested. I pretended to care just to distract myself from the fact that you were right there.Up we went, stopping on 8, and I stepped out to let someone by. Turning back in I saw you were staring at me. I saw the ember in your eyes, a flash of that grin, and again my heart took a pause.Next we stopped on 10. More people got out, leaving my coworkers, you and me. Empty chatter continued about our holiday party the night before. I told my coworker I had a slight headache. He said, ""we've got medicine for that"". I was still just distracting myself.Next we stopped on 11. All of my coworkers got out, but I stayed behind. It wasn't because of you, though another place, another time it might be because of you...I always take the elevator to 12 (our company is spread across 2 floors). The doors closed, leaving just us. There was silence. No more empty chatter. No more distractions. We stood on opposite sides of the elevator not saying a word. Holding our breath. We had 1 whole floor to ourselves, but neither of us dared look up, dared take a chance. I took a breath, and the cowardly route, and dug into my pocket for my cell phone, eyes glazing over empty emails I was going to read in 2 minutes anyway. You said nothing. I waited. Neither of us made a move. Then the bell dinged, the doors opened, and we both walked out.We walked almost next to each other into the doors of our respective offices. Next to each other, but apart. I kicked myself for not saying anything, not doing anything, not even giving you the slightest clue that I'd be ok with you sharing that silly grin again. Even if it didn't lead to anything, it's nice to feel these sorts of connections. I sighed and decided thus is life, and I'd chalk it up to yet another electrifying moment in a fast paced city, fleeting but memorable, one of those moments that makes me love New York so much. I shook my head, laughed, and walked all the way to my desk, smiling. I expected that to be the end of it. Yet another person I'd never see again, a connection I'd never fully make. But I was wrong. Later in the afternoon my boss and I decided to grab coffee outside for our meeting. We never leave to grab coffee, we just happened to do so today. I walked out of our office towards the elevators, fumbling with the zipper on my coat, then finally looked up to see none other than you standing by the elevators. At first you didn't see me because you were talking to a coworker, but then you turned, our eyes met, and for a second I saw your eyes light up and that silly grin flash across your face. The elevator arrived along with the empty chatter with our coworkers, the distractions. Down we went, all the way to the lobby. The bell dinged, the doors opened, and we all walked out. We went our separate ways, back out into the city.We never spoke, never made that full connection, but that's ok. Here's to hoping that at some point in the future I'll see that silly grin again, that I'll have enough courage to actually connect, even if it's just to return a silly grin.",40.7384596,-73.9885037,2015-12-07 01:57:24.91815,2015-12-07 01:57:24.91815,Google Places API

I'm pretty much oblivious to social queues but I thought women liked humor, spontaneity, originality and a lil spicy romance mixed in with their ""omg that's so hot"", no?I met the whole shebang a few weeks back through some friends. I dug her she dug me but I wanted our first time to be memorable, like one of those stories you tell the kids when they're adults asking what mom or dad was like when they weren't bald or grey. We waited a bit, not too long or short but 3 bears kinda right. Recently I took her out for dinner, Italian's romantic, everything was cool. We walked around a bit, bumping into each other as we strolled. Stopped and listened to a saxophone player on the street, I gave him two Hamilton's to play ""I Could Write A Book"", she smiled I smiled. Right about there I'm thinking tonight is the night to have the noise patrol bang on my door.I take her back to my place, we make out a little, drank some red, I mean the mood was set and we both knew it was time. She asked me to give her a few moments, but she said it like ""you know I'm coming out of that bathroom wet and naked, so be ready"" then walked into the bathroom with the sexiest swish I'd ever seen. Now I'm quietly running around looking for something to show her this is going to be a fun experience, I didn't want to break out the cuffs or turkey baster on our first night together, that's more of a 3rd night event. I'm in the kitchen looking for whipped cream when I spotted the small box of figs I bought earlier in the week. Immediately I'm thinking let's go for a biblical motif. I grab a fig leaf, run back to my bedroom, rip my clothes off except for my socks (because the floor is kinda cold and the toe between the middle and piggy on my left foot is a little supernatural, the kinda thing you reveal after the woman has fallen heads over, plus the socks are plaid butterscotch so y'know, why not?). I pounced into bed, laid on my side, head propped up with one arm, leg bent upwards with the foot flat on the mattress and the fig leaf strategically covering my kibbles n bits ...Eve, your Adam awaits.I hear her hand on the doorknob, my heart is racing, I know she's gonna crack up and leap into bed and turn the joint into six flags. She steps out looking absofuckinlutely gorgeous, flawless in fact, she sees me on the bed, pauses for a moment then starts laughing and I'm thinking JACKPOT!! SHE'S MINE!! I made her laugh, she'll call me stupid or silly and swing those hips on her way over ...WRONG, no, that's not what happened at all. She stood there laughing, covered her mouth, laughed, covered her eyes, laughed, turned around and walked back into the bathroom naked while still laughing. I'm thinking she needed a moment to breathe because of my overpowering comical charm. So I'm laying in bed with a raised ""how do you do?"" brow and a dark sexy grin waiting for her return. She exits the bathroom fully clothed ...still laughing, uh ok, she grabs her purse and walks out my front door still laughing down the corridor. WTF X'S 10 right??? I quickly throw on jeans to run after her but she was gone by the time I got outside. Called the cell and it went straight to voicemail.She hasn't returned my calls, completely cut off, sucks but ok, life moves on but I've been wracking my brain trying to figure out what went wrong. I thought we hit it off. I know I'm a lil chubby but that can't be it, it's not like she couldn't tell I'm not the skinny jeans wearing type of guy, Was it my facial expression? Was I smiling too much or too little? Should I have posed with my ass facing her even though the fig leaf would have looked really weird covering my back door? Should I have turned off the lights first? I don't get it. To make things even more awkward I think she told our mutual friends about the night, no one has said anything specific but they keep calling me Fig Leaf or Figgy or Newton ...I don't know, maybe that's just coincidental.Anyway, I'm too embarrassed to ask any friends for insight, I mean I'd never hear the end of it if they knew I liked romantic jazz ballads.

By feeling - what it is like during and without. (And, by the way, I will continue to use words that I hope you don't know so that you dictionary.com them and find out their real meaning. I know you're so over 'earnestly,' even if I'm not.) I'm convinced caring makes up for that as well. But it doesn't make the time withoutgo by any quicker. And you still must try to exist, even if you believe yourself nothing more than a fallacy. We are reading the same book, you and I. You - page 135, Me - the end (to make sure we are headed in the right direction. We have been for while, but we're noticing different things. And our stories are different).

""Well, she'd be classier, sexier, more cultured. . . She'd probably wear pearls or something"". I asked the same question of you, and you told me that ""he"" would be braver, smoother, and more confident. . . Clearly, that makes two of us or I wouldn't be writing this letter to you, hoping it'll find you well. Instead, I would have grabbed you by the lapels and matched my lips to yours that evening we explored Little Italy for, what felt like, the first time. . . or finally worked up the courage to confess my growing emotions that night we watched one of our favorite shows on your fire escape months ago under that summer moon. The other evening, you had asked me if I'd ever truly been in love. ""Yes, just once, I suppose"". . . .But, that wasn't an entirely honest response. I asked the same question of you. ""No, I don't think I really ever have"". You mentioned the difficulty distinguishing between love and familiarity. I told you my philosophy on soulmates. Love's a funny thing, though. . . I've always chalked it up to lust and comfort and familiarity. But, you have to admit, there's something far more mystical about it. . . I recall a very early morning in late June. We were on the J train. . . You know that long haul between Marcy and Essex. . . You and I were traveling home after a long night of filming in Brooklyn and I pointed out the breathtaking view of the city. We took a break from our banter to take in the sights. You thoughtfully took everything in. . . Wandering in between train car windows to catch every possible angle. Anyway, there are a few things I never told you about that day. . . The evening prior, on my way to that very shoot, I rode the same train and admired the same beautiful surroundings. The moment was picturesque. But, I remember thinking ""I really wish I could share this with someone. . ."" Someone who would genuinely understand the loveliness that was surrounding me at that exact minute. That exact second. I felt so very fortunate to be able to share that moment with you. And, to be honest, watching you find the beauty in the exact same sights I had only hours earlier, warmed my heart. And, another thing: In that 4 minute journey into Manhattan, as we watched the cars and buildings sail passed us, the same excitement a small child feels on Christmas morning overtook me. I knew in that exact moment that I could love you. We were mere Subway Buddies then. In the time since, you've become my partner in crime. My rock/paper/scissors. I joke about the first time we met. . .. You rolled your eyes at my lame attempt at a joke (though I know you'll claim you never did such a thing!) and I thought to myself ""there's no way this kid and I are going to get along!"". Turns out, I couldn't have been more wrong. . . We ended up with a relationship far more dear to my heart than I'd ever imagined. The last thing I aim to do is scare you off with my overly flowery words. . . You know how us writers can be! I just wanted to let you know how very special you are to me, my dear.

3454,5342841229,You took my order one summer day - w4m,2015-12-03 00:35,/lgi/mis/5342841229.html,lgi,w4m,"","I still remember you. As I was rearranging my bookshelf, I saw the small, white, paper bag I had kept from a not so remote summer night. The bag you put my marzipan fruits inside of. It was late July and the moon didn't care to show her face early. She eased in gently, and so did the evening. I was wearing a light pink blouse and brown, tortoise shell glasses. I had short, brown hair. It was unkempt for the humidity had plagued it. We wanted to go elsewhere this time, not just the same old places we go to. We stopped at Kilwins Chocolates. I saw a motley array of chocolates through the window. I decided I would stop in and see what I liked. I saw all the different ways chocolates were made, laid out in front of me. Different shapes, sizes, decorations. I didn't want any of those. Then I saw the marzipan fruits, colorful and small. Little bananas, strawberries, oranges, the like. I saw you. You were skinny. Not gaunt or gawky, but lithe and poised. You had dark hair and olive skin. You had black glasses that framed your face beautifully. You weren't like those other boys who exude an air of arrogance and thickheaded, millenial squareness. I saw you...and I was shocked at how beautifully and naturally perfect you were to my eyes. I immediately tried to hide the fact that in that moment I fancied you. I tried not to look at you for longer than a second, thinking about how ugly and weird I was. You asked me what I was having and I motioned that I was still deciding. You waited for me to make my decision. I said, ""I'll take some of these, please."" You put tree little colorful marzipan fruits into the paper bag. I tried not to look at you at all as you rang me up. You said "".75 cents"", and after I paid I said thank you in a small voice. As we walked out of Kilwins, I held the white paper bag, folded the way you had. The memory of you was so fresh in my mind and I was taken over still with surprise by your existence that I didn't eat the little fruits right away. I let them sit there. My parents kept talking to each other and I walked alongside them, in silence. I grew fond of you, a stranger. I pressed the little bag to my chest as if to embrace it. You did not even know. You were ringing up other people by then. I opened the small bag and ate the first marzipan fruit. You didn't know it, but you had brought a piece of my childhood back to me. It had been lost so long ago within years. I didn't even know it existed in the archives of my memory until that first bite. The soft and grainy texture, its sweet, almost cloying, almondy taste. I ate the second. I saved the third for the car ride back. I ate it in the darkness of the car in the back seat, thinking of you still. Now every time I pass by that area, near those stores where Kilwins is, I think of you. I recently passed by it just the other day. I remembered you. I went home that day and saved that little bag. I left it among my books in my bookshelf, hidden. I wondered the moment after I left if you thought I was as beautiful as I think you are. If you felt a connection. At all? It was a normal day for you at your job. But it was a lifetime for me and a memory I still can't forget. I am not sure if I ever will. I hope I can see you once more. I imagined what it would be like if I saw you again, if I visited you there. How happy I would be. I imagined what it would be like to befriend you and walk up and down the streets of Babylon village, grab ice cream, laugh and talk. I wouldn't be frizzy or wearing a silly blouse but I would be wearing a dress a little above my knees and blousy, long sleeves and my hair would be lustrous. I hope I can see you once more even if just a glance. I always have a way to remember you, with this little bag that I kept. I refused to throw it away. I apologize if I am some kind of loser or creep of a girl. I am neither of those, I simply feel so much in this lifetime...especially for people like you. I hope that anywhere you are and whatever you are doing, you are happy. I really do. You made me feel that way that summer evening. As if I was walking on clouds and I felt ethereal thinking of you walking down the street with my marzipan fruits.",29.2985278,42.55096029999999,2015-12-07 01:59:49.797657,2015-12-07 01:59:49.797657,Google Places API
3455,5342833876,"Looking for Joseph, at a Micronesian restaurant - m4m",2015-12-03 00:31,/brk/mis/5342833876.html,brk,m4m,Williamsburg/Greenpoint,"I'm looking for a 30ish-year-old man named Joseph, who worked as a chef at a Polynesian restaurant and lived in a house in Brooklyn/Williamsburg. We met in the fall of 2014, on the street outside a bar, and I came back to your house with you and some of your friends, where we hung out and talked into the early morning.You and I started to see each other more and more often. The exact nature of our relationship was undefined. I liked you a lot, and I think you cared about me, but I was going through a very tough time in my life. I drank heavily and often. I prioritized alcohol over everything else in my life. I was mentally unstable. My behavior embarrasses me to this day. I stopped using my phone. I had stopped communicating with my family at this point in my addiction, and I could not bear the sight of their texts, calls, and voicemails, all left unanswered. They did not know where I was. One day I let my phone die and decided, under the guise of simplifying my life, that I would not turn it back on, for an undetermined amount of time. This meant that we could not talk, either. I knew this at the time but didn't think on it. I knew that it was wrong and unfair and selfish, but I cast it out of my mind. I have always excelled at pushing those who show any interest in my wellbeing away. After a few days, you showed up at the restaurant where I worked, a few miles south of the neighborhood where we both lived. The restaurant had not yet opened for service, and as I was going through the monotony of setting up, your face appeared in one of the small panes of the front door. I experienced two odd feelings simultaneously: I felt the strange, coincidental spark of seeing someone familiar in an unexpected setting and, more keenly, the sharp recognition that your actions have consequences, that the shitty way you live your life can affect the lives of others, that you can hurt people no matter how helpless and insignificant you feel. I almost cried when I saw you, but I was so emotionally numb that outwardly I hardly responded at all. We stepped outside, and I downplayed the dead phone situation. I assured you that I was okay. I can't remember if I expressed remorse for causing you any undue worry. You looked more than concerned. Maybe hurt as well? It was hard to tell, but the look on your face still appears in my mind from time to time. But -- fortunately -- more often than that look I see your smile. I've never seen anything like it. It's hard to describe, and impossible to capture with words. More than the smile itself I remember the lines that formed at the corners of your eyes, the way your arms moved towards your chest and how your body sort of retreated into itself. And the laugh, too -- it was a giggle, really -- and it was probably the only thing that made me feel genuinely happy when I lived in New York. I moved away earlier this year. We spoke via text once this spring, but I lost your number when I updated my phone. I kick myself everyday for losing it.Over Thanksgiving, I was reading a book on exuberance, in which the author relates the story of Mr. Toad, who Wikipedia describes as ""intelligent, creative and resourceful [but] also narcissistic, self-centered to the point of sociopathy, and completely lacking in even the most basic common sense."" In our last conversation, you told me not to be like Mr. Toad. I've been trying. I went to rehab. I stopped drinking. I'm in recovery. I've been writing a lot and trying to think about myself, in terms of self-improvement and not of selfishness/self-centeredness. Inevitably, though, my thoughts return to you. I wanted to thank you for caring about me when I did not care about others. When I did not care about myself. When I kept a bottle of sleeping pills under my pillow with the hope that I would get drunk enough to swallow them all. What I wouldn't give to hear from you. To see your smile and hear your laugh, just once. Probably this will never happen. I don't even know if you are still in NY, or if you would even speak to me. And that's okay. But I hope that you do find this, or that someone who knows you finds this and shows it to you. Because you deserve to know how great you were and are.Thank you, Joseph. Thank you. Thank you.",40.728820,-73.945971,2015-12-07 01:59:50.188304,2015-12-07 01:59:50.188304,detail page

I just finally got sick of myself, good intentions no excuse to waste energy on those not willing to take responsibility for themselves. to in essence punish others I loved and who loved me, who deserved the best from me. to let it go, realize the best intentions for others doesn't give us the right to dictate the outcome, expect them to see the truth in our time line. to waste so much emotion, energy on those not willing to see the truth . only want their ""solution"". I found peace, as others have, to walk away from those not willing to face truth, make sense. I was just sick of myself. so I really don't judge, I learned it must be left alone after offering to do what i'm willing and walk away when i'm not . let ppl learn in their own time. so yes, I'm still intense at times, passionate about some things, want the best for people, but......but make others ""nervous, but in a good way"", trusted above all others to most who know me. like a tiger you can pet, your positive it will never harm you, but still ""nervous"". they see a positive will, a loving spirit. yet no one knows, you never knew. no one can close enough to know. despite that spirit to see what's joyful, seek what is beautiful to the soul........sometimes the darkness seeps in, I pray, I wish I could sleep and not awake again. so that ""make a wish kiss"" that December day? my wish, god show me the truth about her, good or bad, i'll accept it. but dear god you know me.

""Your post seems sincere so I will respond in kind.I can only speak for myself as I am only one of presumably millions of visitors to CL.I don't use CL for sex at all, I've never met anyone on this site for the purpose of getting laid. However I'll admit I have been abusive to posters I felt were deserving of ridicule and scorn. Many ads are vapid and insipid from the start but some individuals go beyond an acceptable point (at least in my mind) and I can't help myself. Depending on the individual I occasionally have felt remorse when receiving an e-mail from them and gaining a little more perspective on their situation but that doesn't make me any less of an anus. So no, I don't come here to mess with ""people's bodies"".I'm not sure what you mean by ""messing with minds"". I have written posts for the sole purpose of causing readers to question if I'm really that fucked in the head or just have a bizarre sense of humor. The answer is a little of both, I do have a very dark and quizzical sense of humor and 95% of my posts are purely for my own entertainment, I won't respond to e-mails unless it's clear they get that I'm just fucking around, but I'm also a very damaged human being incapable of what I assume the average person would define as ""normal"" interaction with others. So I guess I mess with minds in a general sense but not individual. I treat CL as both a place for me to make myself laugh while at the same time reserving the idea that I could meet someone who understands where I'm coming from and could possibly get to know. I'm not delusional enough to hold my breathe.I wouldn't classify myself as shady because I don't take advantage of people on or offline, I don't ask for anything from anyone (i.e. money, sex, gifts, pictures etc) probably because I want nothing asked of me, and the few times I've met anyone from CL in person the intent was strictly to see if we'd get along as friends or as collaborators, nothing shady occurred but I imagine some people here might be, probably no more shady than anyone you'd meet offline.Yes, I've had a very rough life starting from early childhood and you're right, people raised in loving supportive homes don't generally turn out like me or whatever it is your friends told you inhabit CL. I don't consciously use my experiences as an excuse for myself, but I also don't excuse the profound affect my experiences have had on me. Some things will stay with me until the end, I'm not thrilled about it, I just accept that in many ways I am abnormal and there's no point in attempting to hide it. Prejudgments, not much anyone can do about that.No, I'm not addicted to anything other than nicotine and I'm not even 100% certain of that anymore. I've met a couple of addictive personality types but I couldn't say how many CL visitors are here because of an addiction.What is there to get? People are lonely, scared, frustrated, angry, depressed, bitter. They want someone to connect with but don't know how to go about it, so they come here and either write a sincere post or vent. Those that attack probably do so out of a sense of grief, anger or rejection, they want to be acknowledged in any way shape or form and I think many have given up on positive reinforcement, so negative will have to do. Children often learn the best way to get attention from mom and dad is to scream and act out ...what is there to get? it's all so blatantly obvious, or maybe that's just my own myopic view.I can't speak for every single person but based on my own observations and the few I've met, I'd say there are varying degrees of mental illness permeating this site. No two snowflakes are alike, the same can be said for people/psychopaths. Two people can have the same exact experience down to the finest detail and walk away with separate outcomes. One may be more compassionate and understanding because of that horrible experience, while the other may be completely toxic, then there are combinations of either attribute, sympathetic in certain regards and ruthlessly ice cold in other's. There isn't a broad stroked rationale. Yeah, maybe everyone here is sick, but sick in different ways and for different reasons, from mild to wild, who knows? Perhaps with enough responses you'll draw your own conclusionI don't visit many social sites and the few others I do are specific to genre music, literature, psychology, science whatever and no one really deviates from the purpose of those particular forums. You can try meetup.com, there are social groups that meet in person to share, discuss and enjoy mutual interests. I've signed up but never followed through so I can't yay or nay that site.Anyway, you can tell your friends that a man answered your post and didn't come on to you sexually or send you a dick pic, I'm sure their heads will explode hearing that.Have a Good Morning""I would paste your post here but it's gone. Anyway, that's my vague take on CL and clearly I haven't invalidated the opinion of your friends.",40.7127837,-74.0059413,2015-12-07 02:00:32.592711,2015-12-07 02:00:32.592711,Google Places API

Even in the very formation of their claims.Seriously, if you're going to go off on a diatribe like you just did--choose 'safer ground' from which to preach. Rely on more solid examples to support your assertions.Most of your post is a rant against stalkers and harassment. Okay, fine. But you don't know enough about internet law to go around trying to scare people with threats of lawsuit. That's #1.#2, if you're going to take such an intellectual, lordly posture and waggle-your-finger down at the rest of us, you'd better know how to write intelligently. Halfway through your post you descend into pure gibberish. It was overly-wordy to the point of unintelligibility. Learn how to state your points succinctly if you want impact. Less is more. You kept reiterating your gripes--various ways of stating the same premise--and you quickly lost all the force you were hoping for.Finally, this theory of yours (below) is entirely thin. An 'audience' can certainly identify traits in a performer ...regardless of the performance the actor *believe* they provided.  The actor is the least trustworthy authority on what they conveyed with their performance. Audience input is the final --and sole--arbitrator of whether the actor was convincing or not.You can certainly follow the career of an actor and make all sorts of observations about their personality regardless of the roles they take up or the masks they don. It is merely ""actor's conceit"" to believe they are totally submerged in a role by the power or skill in their portrayal. Wrong: The fact that you think you can genuinely ""know"" a woman based upon the roles in entertainment she chooses to consider, e.g. she played a werewolf so she must be a werewolf, she played a bitch, so she must be a bitch, is just plain stupid and downright ignorant of you.It's a darn shame you don't want things hurled in your face, but this weak rationale of yours is not the way to undercut such public castigation.",40.649912,-73.949806,2015-12-07 02:03:54.950334,2015-12-07 02:03:54.950334,Google Places API

It's that slight window for success, combined with the grim reality of the situation - eliminating the anxiety created by said success - that is the beauty of Craigslist.Hello strangers. Considering you're the audience to be reading this, I first wanted to acknowledge and greet you. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to pretend you don't exist, and proceed to write the following as if the only eyes to be laid on it are those of the person in question, which we've already established won't happen.Not everything in life needs to have a superficial meaning, so don't look for one.Here goes:I can't read you. Are you interested in me? If so, is it full-time? Part-time? Freelance? You do know that those with full-time status receive benefits, right? Part-timers get to attend uninspired meetings in a cheap effort to make them feel like they're included, and the ones who freelance, well, they're just taken advantage of and shit upon. I'm comfortable with you in any role - I just need to know which one you prefer, as I can then move to fill the other positions.**Please take note, the above doesn't necessarily pertain to a romantic relationship. It's all-encompassing.In fairness to you, I probably don't make the effort to read you, nor do I allow myself to be read. The reason for this isn't because I view this as a game, but because I'm not sure of how to advance, and therefore shy away from a situation in which I'd have to do so. There are many factors involved in this confusion. Here are a few, listed in no particular order:1) At this point in my life, I'm done with baseless alliances. I want something of substance, whether it be a friendship or more. I'm not sure you're at this same stage.2) There are other people involved - friends and family near and dear to us. Furthering things and subsequently fucking them up fucks those people up, too, probably creating one of those fucking rifts in which people feel as if they must pick fucking sides. That's a lot of fucking pressure not to fuck up.3) I like downers and you like uppers.I'm aware these are all issues that are easily solved by real, face to face communication.

I was in the real world now, independent as much as a 17 yr old could be.

I came to your office back in 2007 or so because I was having a dispute with my roommate. You were a free Pro Se attorney there and gave me advice on how to deal with her (in the Resource Room/Help Center, room 404 I believe). I remember you being kind of angry and bossy and impatient, not at me, just in general, like the job was driving you crazy. I could understand, given the circumstances and the ghetto, thuggish crowd you mostly deal with there (on that particular day I saw you, a black man with dreads in the elevator threatened to ""shoot up the place"" because he didn't want to wait on line anymore and you called Security on him... another time I went a 20 something female accused some 70 year old woman of ""flirting with her man"" just because the older lady said excuse me as they formed a queue/line, and the young woman then threatened to beat her up. Ridiculous stuff like that.. You were one of the most intense people I've ever met...You were impeccably dressed in a navy blue suit, a fit white male with dark, dark brown hair and beautiful cheekbones to match intensely blue eyes. There's nothing sexier than a man bossin' a woman around. I need a man like that- one who is 'in charge' and in touch with his masculinity. Naturally dominant, no props needed... Let me stroke that hair and those cheekbones and melt you down... I'm a swf (white), 5 ft 7, 35 years old, with long auburn colored hair, curvy where it counts (back and front), very busty, green eyes.

If so, Let's connect & make sure it never happens again! NoMoreMissedConnections**** who am I?Ever since I was a baby, I have searched for ways to carve out my own, unique path in life. I say this with a slight chuckle because I was born an identical twin, so finding anything ""unique"" or ""totally fresh"" was inherently challenging. Still, I was determined to find my own way - I wanted badly to the guide my sister's every step since birth and would jump at the opportunity to lead friends in school or even strangers on the play ground. I was always seeking positive transformations in my own life, and then praying for opportunities to impact and LEAD others with my knowledge, resources and gifts. A renegade, this did not make...a fiercely independent and creative woman, it did. **** what do I do?I am blessed to say that I come from a family of women who are of similar mind. In addition, I humbly say that over the past few years, I have been invited into the inner circles of other people who dream just as big as I do and EVEN BIGGER. They taught me how to take life by the horns, live my beliefs and dreams out loud, and literally wrestle each day to not only meet my own goals, but to help others reach theirs. I am a female entrepreneur with a unique take on life in business because I have now teamed up with my mother and twin sister to help people celebrate positive transformation at any stage and at any age in life. I'm writing simply to connect with someone who needs to hear my story...someone searching for a transformation...someone searching for direction. I find the missed connections portion of Craigslist incredibly fascinating, as so many people are trying to establish a connection with a person they had a small encounter with or felt an immediate connection from, but for some reason never got their name and contact information. I'm blown away by the creative poems, funny pictures, and even romantic out-pour for something or someone that was lost. As an entrepreneur, I'm impressed by the bold moves people make and the guts it takes for them to just ""put themselves out there for love.""As I read one post after the other, I'm more intrigued and question after question fills my head as I imagine each scenario coming to life. 1). When we post about a brief magical encounter with a stranger, is there something else we are seeking? Is there a void in our personal lives that we hope romance, love, or a fling can fill?2). When we post about a ""missed opportunity"" to meet someone, do we STOP to think about the other types of opportunities we have missed? If so, how do we go back to pursue them? 3). Do we think it's possible to go back and pursue missed opportunities, hidden dreams, expired connections, forgotten mentors, old business opportunities?4).

Since then, we have both journeyed into life with our significant others. After a recent surge in wealth, I plan to start my next chapter in 1 to 2 years.

3833,5358320007,Unprecedented Presenture,2015-12-13 11:45,/jsy/mis/5358320007.html,jsy,ure,NYC,"Ok I'm thinking about this as I go but I'm pretty certain its the move to make. I'm going to begin posting all NEW lyrics to tracks I am currently working on here, on Craigslist. Why am I doing this you might ask? According to my research, Craigslist is currently in the top 10 of the most frequently visited websites on the internet. I gotta believe at this point that not only are my postings read but posting here has furthered a great deal of my writing and artistic expressions particularly from an experimental vantage. Now back in the days, as far back as to when AOL was the only game in town, I remember plenty of lyricists posting their freestyles and what have you in chatrooms and things and these people were dubbed ""trolls"" or ""loggers"" and generally speaking even I, thought it was pure dumb; a revelation of unpolished form, unharnessed talent, or lack there of. Let me say this so it is not misinterpreted...letting people view your writings is never, never a bad way to go. One then does open oneself to the opportunity of having many people weigh in on your work, so your sensitivity to criticism must be considered or leveled, due to vehement opposition and downright hatred that may or may not surface. Here's the crux of the thing. I am looking for collaborators, co-conspirators, partners and others that will take the baton where I want to hand it off. How can this be accomplished? Well, if you have the interest in playing a vital role in this groundbreaking milestone in hip-hop/rap and music form, on the whole, you can do so by submitting your dope lyrics to me directly. I will reply with the beat that I am writing my lyrics to and you will receive all pertinent information and tracking from an official authenticated e-mail address just so their will be no confusion and so that you can be assured that I am 150% certain of what to do. So what else needs to be covered? Theft and artistic license. That is to ask, 'how will I know others aren't going to lift my writing and use it to profit and drive their own projects?' That unfortunately, is a distinct possibility. You have my solemn confidence I'm not going to take from you. However, if word that lyrics are being pilfered, or beatjacking, happens to leak, a simple, simple thing is going to happen...I'm going to personally come to your performance and out rap you. Cuz, there is no way anyone can realistically flow the way I flow because I invented the lyrics and paired them with the beat of my choosing and they fit like a ball and mitt my friend. There ARE some stipulations. You must be from New York State, NYC, out of state, but NOT from Staten Island. Now you may say 'but that's crazy, thats your peoples, your stomping grounds, how can you think of initiating this undertaking without including fellow Staten Islanders?' I thought that through and I have examined some of SI's hip hop origins and releases and find that they consist of mostly compilations that include one track from one guy one track from another, a semi-circle or group, or just some acquaintances and individuals that put they heads together. That's cool, I like that. This time, it'll be different. I'm going to be on every joint. Sorry. It must be this way, its setting in stone. There may be some naysayers or doubters wondering why I wouldn't just try to lure the bigger fish, established acts, recognized names, those who have experienced success in the game, to participate or invest in this tape. That is because, for the most part, those at the top do not see those at the bottom at their feet. I do not blame you. We are piranha. At no time will you receive an offer from me for monetary compensation associated with your involvement. Due to the ever changing landscape of the music business via the internet including downloads and streaming services, to this day I have not figured out how to make any money at this. I am humbled if you have, I think it makes you a better person; moreover, I am NOT seeking a tutorial on cash flow or asset acquisition. Finally, and this is like, a big deal...what will be said by the purists, those who love ambiguity and anonymity, whom aim to keep the internet and the world stuck in a stagnant pond of misery, like a manufacturing plant with rusty gears : an analogy. If I were buying a couch on here, I rather buy a couch from a dude named Flow then just a dude with a couch, ya heard. What I'm said.

3966,5356625304,"How People Steal Your Power, Energy and Soul - w4mw",2015-12-12 03:52,/mnh/mis/5356625304.html,mnh,4mw,"","You must see what's really going on when you're feeling confusedand responses and reactions in certain situations are not making any sense.By Peter MichaelOne of the most untalked about subjects is the subject of how people steal other people's power, soul and energy.It is more common then you can understand and it goes beyond the realm of the physical dimension with people and extends into the non-physical dimension with non-physical beings.People on earth have what is called the soul, or personal power. The soul of humans is something that can be taken or given away or stolen. The act of ""soul stealing"" is a common phenomenon among people in relationships where one person is a dominating or power taking person.People also have what is called an energy field or aura . A common problem that most people have is that somewhere in life they became dis-connected to their own personal power or soul and because of this they have become dependent on the energy of other people. The term ""Energy vampire"", or ""Psychic Vampire"" is often a misunderstood term, but it is basically a person who lives and feeds off the life force or energy of other people. The ""energy vampire"" person is actually unable to develop their own energy, and in turn they have to go ""outside"" of themselves to get energy. The main cause of energy stealing or feeding is a lack of connection to ones own personal power or soul, for if you had a connection to yourself on a deeper level you would have no need to use other people for energy. It is extremely common among humans although only a few people are actually aware of it, in terms of having to protect their own energy from being stolen or used by others. On a deeper level, the act of taking or using someone else's energy is based on having power over another person, and it is a lower level of consciousness that people have chosen to operate under.A common belief is that energy vampires are negative people or use negativity to drain you, although this is not true. Someone can take your energy just by you speaking to them, listening to them speak, looking at them, or being close to them in terms of space, (like if you were to stand very close to another person). It has nothing to do with being negative, it has to do with a person who is on a lower vibration energetically, and just by dealing with them, your energy is taken.What is even more interesting is most people who take or use other people's energy, do not know they do it. This is because most people do not understand how energy works, therefore they have no idea they are draining you of your energy. The people who understand how energy works and are also users of other people's energy are what I call ""Professional thieves"" meaning they actually purposely choose to use other people for energy. I had a friend at one time in my life who told me she would purposely ""steal"" other people's energy and feed off of other people energetically. I asked her how she did it and she said, ""with her mind"". She said she would pull people to her intentionally just with her thoughts and by just someone paying attention to her, she could take their energy. I asked: so a person has to be paying attention to you?, and she said yes, by them paying attention to me, they give me their energy. This makes a lot of sense, because whatever people focus on, they tend to give their energy to. I later found myself always tired and drained around this ""friend"".Whenever we have a relationship or interaction with another human, the other human we are having the relationship with or interaction will either function on two levels.The first level is the giver level, this is a person who does not have any type of hidden agenda or desire to control or have power over others. This level is how people should function with one another. This level is what is right and respectful within the universe as the way you are ""supposed"" to operate as a human being. Within the universe humans are supposed to be beings who ""share"" their energy with each other, and not take one another's energy and not give back anything in return.The giver is a person who is connected to the ""light"" as they say, meaning, this person has a connection to his or her own inner power/soul and has no need to use other people for energy, because they can develop their own energy. This is how you are ""supposed"" to function as a human being.-The giver has an energy field ( aura ) which develops its own energy and in turn gives that energy to others.The second level is the user/abuser and taker level.The user is the human who has chosen to dominate, control, have power over, or manipulate one another as a way to compensate for his or her own lack of power, understanding and soul. The user may be completely unaware of his or her actions and functions on ""automatic pilot"", not really knowing who they are and why they operate the way they do.Some users understand more then others and actually purposely steal other people's power, energy and soul.The user tends to associate with other users and givers usually avoid these types of people. The user may be in high profile positions, such as teachers, healers, leaders, etc. The user is more common within the race of humans then the giver. This is due mostly to unhealthy choices and being spiritually dis-connected to ones own power and soul. The user tends to operate under fear, which is due to his or her own lack of power, understanding, and higher consciousness. The user functions at a level at which non-physical beings of a dark nature function at, which is a level of over powering one another, dominating one another, or attempting to control one another.-The user has an energy field ( aura ) which is reversed, meaning it does not develop its own energy, but instead it gets its energy from outside of itself, from other people.As we deal with one another in a social or sexual relationship, we exchange energies completely unseen by the naked eye. When a user operates with another user there is very little power lost or stolen between the two people as they are both users and operating at the same level.When a user operates with a giver, there is an imbalance of energy exchanges. What this means is the user cannot give or exchange energy because of his or her lack of power, while the giver tends to ""give"" energy to the other person which is the user. So this imbalance creates a unhealthy relationship between the two people, as one person takes and the other person gives. As the relationship develops the user can actually steal whole parts of power or soul from the other person who is a giver. These parts of power or soul that are stolen from the giver are usually unknown to them because of their lack of understanding of how the soul functions on an energy level in regards to ""Soul Loss"". As parts of personal power are stolen they create openings or holes in the energy field. Once a person begins to develop holes in his or her energy field they are ""energetically vulnerable"" meaning they have power missing from them which in turn has caused them to be open energetically to non-physical beings. The attachment of non-physical beings in a persons energy field is what causes a person to develop lower levels of consciousness, energy, and power. The more power a person has stolen from another person, the more power is lost from that person and the more energetically vulnerable that person becomes.It is important to understand that we are not living in a world that is made of kind and loving beings, although you may believe you are. The darker truth of life is that this world we live in is made mostly of fear based beings, lower level humans, and dark consciousness. For if we lived in a loving world there would be no need to fight, battle, have power over each other, start wars, or hurt one another.The fact that humans have lived for thousands of years, and have created nothing but sickness, pain and misery within one another is only an example of how humans operate on a deeper level.Now, I believe there is a time for change. That we must understand what is wrong in order to fix it.That we must choose to understand who we are, and learn to make the choice to not live in fear, or give our power to others, or allow fear and lower level energy into our lives.Until we understand that there is no more need for fear, or pain or misery we will never change.To make the choice to become spiritually intelligent is to understand who we really are.Who we are is not a living breathing human being, but we are much more then that. We are soul beings, trapped in a physical body until we make the choice to leave this world.So when a person comes to you to steal your power, what are you going to say to them?No! You cannot steal my power, go get your own energy and power and stop using other people for your own personal benefit. When we make the choice to not allow others to use us, we choose to become self-empowered through our own choices to not allow other people to make us sick.Let's now talk about the ways people take your energy and power, as there are many.1. The Eyes, and Your Body Position when speaking to someone.The eyes are an important tool for transferring energy. The eyes have been called the 'window of the soul' for a reason. We can give and take energy through the eyes. If someone needs you to focus on them, you will need to look at them. When people look at something they are focusing on what they are looking at, giving it energy and attention. Whatever you focus on you give your energy to. Also the body and the position of the body is very important. Standing directly in front of energy vampires is giving them direct access to your heart chakra and center of your being. It is this position of your body which is not beneficial when speaking to people who absorb others energy. So when talking to someone who uses others for their energy try to not make eye contact with them, or face them directly.2. ConflictPeople who use others for energy will need you to focus on them and feed them. This is how most energy feeding is done. So what they will do is get you to fight them, argue with them, play their emotional and power stealing games. They will feed off your emotional reaction. They will attempt to get you to ""play"" their game by reacting. They will feed off the energy fed into the conflict. The easiest (and oldest) way to steal someone's energy and power is to start an argument or conflict with them and feed off their reaction. So when someone starts to begin some sort of conflict with you, you need to examine whether it is worth your energy to ""fight back"". Some battles are best dealt with by walking away and saying NO.3. Name Calling, Gossip, Emotional AttacksPeople will need to get you to react emotionally and feel hurt to give away your power. People need you to focus your mind on them and what they are manipulating you with. So what better of a way then to call you a name or emotionally attack you in some way? Mostly all power games revolve around making you feel hurt, or embarrassed, or weak, or powerless. So this method involves various acts of demoting your quality of being. Treating you in a way that hurts your emotional self.4.People Treating You As If You Are Of No Worth or powerless, Power and Domination GamesAnother similar tactic is to attempt to treat you like you are of low worth, or someone who lacks a certain skill or quality. The way a ""boss"" has power over his employees is to treat them like they are beneath him, and if the employees accept his beliefs they give away a certain amount of power. The way parents have power over their children is to keep them held down with limiting beliefs such as ""you're not good enough"", or ""you will never attain that"". Limiting beliefs is another way to steal someone's power.5. Talking Too Much, Asking Redundant or Pointless QuestionsA very simple and common way to use others for energy is to ask them pointless questions. You need to get someone to give you their energy, so getting them to talk or listen to you talk nonstop is an effective method. A person will come up and ask ""Do you know where the supermarket is"", when the supermarket is right across the street or they very well know exactly where it is. Or they will talk, and talk, and talk, about anything, it does not have to be a dumping of negativity, it can just be listening to them speak on end. The more you listen, the more energy you give away, the more they get you to talk, the more energy you give away.6. Trying To Be The Center Of AttentionSome people when they walk into a room talk extremely loud and attempt to make their presence known. This is a subtle energy feeding method which is designed to draw your attention to them, thereby focusing on them, which gives them energy. People who constantly need to be paid attention to have severe inner issues of needing love and attention from others. This is what little children do when they do not get what they want, they cry and create drama. Don't allow people to come into your life and force you to pay attention to them if they are not deserving of your attention.7. Dumping Negative or Emotional or Heavy Crap On YouRelated to number 4, is dumping heavy or emotional stuff on you. Negativity is very draining, so a person can sit and talk about their problems, and how this is going wrong, and how life is so hard, and on and on and before you know it you are drained, and they walk away feeling uplifted because they just fed off your light by dumping their dark crap on you. Again, having boundaries with people is the lesson.8. Emotional or Heavy RelationshipsAn emotional or heavy relationship is draining and some people seek out these types of relationships. Related to number 1, this relationship revolves around drama, pain, heavy emotions, and conflict. Constant arguing is a sure fire way to give away your energy and power. Understand that you could die at any moment and spending your time upset and bent out of shape because of a women or man you are in a relationship with is an extremely unhealthy existence. Avoid drama, or anything emotionally heavy at all costs.9. Sex/IntercourseOne of the easiest ways to drain someone else is through sex. Sex is not just a physical interaction, it is an energetic and spiritual interaction. The biggest ""feeders"" I have met used sex as their weapon of choice. Understand that if you are a ""giver"" of energy like so very few people are and you have sex with a ""feeder"" you are basically making a choice to give away your life force energy and power for a brief moment of physical pleasure. Now sex is not a bad thing, but if it starts to become draining, then you need to find another person to have that experience with. We did not come to this planet to give our power away to others, we came here to grow as a collective group of beings, and if the beings we are dealing with are not playing the same game as we are, we need to shift and change those relationships.10. Invasion of Personal Space/Being Very Close To Unhealthy PeopleThis is a little more advanced, but some people can feed off of you by just standing close to you. Since your energy field (aura) extends around your body in a distance of 5 feet give or take, those who are more experienced ""feeders"" will simply feed off your energy by standing close to you. You would not believe the amount of people who have tried to stand extremely close to me in order to feed off my aura. It is almost a joke. But this is what some due in order to steal your power and energy.11. At distance Feeding aka ""Cording""Another more advanced method used by those who are highly skilled is to focus their feeding from a distance. Yes some people can actually feed off your energy psychically by using their mind and focusing on ""cording"" with you. ""Cords"" work by very thin thread like energetic cords (almost like tentacles) being connected to you to feed off you. Some people can project their cords from a distance to you and suck and steal energy from you. You usually have to be within eye distance of them, but it can be done and it is done on a daily by those who are more skilled at using others for energy.12. Psychic CordsUnlike normal energy ""cords"", psychic cords are a psychic connection you have with another person. You may constantly have dreams with a particular person, or you may constantly think about another person. You may think about someone and speak to them and they said they just thought about you. These are psychic connections and some of them are unhealthy because the people we are connected with ""psychically"" are unhealthy. If you are psychically connected to someone who is unhealthy, they can absorb some of your energy and power through dreams and other methods of psychic interaction.13. Violence, Fear, Anger and IntimidationAn extreme way of stealing another person's power is to attempt to intimidate them or physically attack them, for if someone is coming at you to hurt you, you will have no choice but to fight back and defend yourself. It is this defending yourself that will drain you. It is the heavy emotional crap you will go through while defending yourself that will drain you. It is the fear you feel when someone attempts to threaten you with physical harm that will drain you. Fear and anger are one in the same, so if someone gets you angry and upset at them that anger will drain you. These are all the extremely deceptive and manipulative ways some people use to steal our power. So be careful with who attempts to scare or hurt you. Defense is necessary in some instances but not all. The warrior way is to avoid conflict at all costs, and walking away is sometimes the best defense. Fear no one, unless you like being afraid. Fear is extremely dis-empowering and it is the greatest tool of all to steal another person's power and energy. If you could get everyone to fear you, what a great master of dis-empowerment you would be. But people choose to be afraid. It is a learned response and choice common among people who are not in their power. People can also project their fears and anger and negative emotions on to you as a sort of psychic attack and that will drain you as well. Learn to be in your power and develop emotional control and you will respond less and less to life with fear.Author's Bio:Peter Michael is a angel healer, clairsentient, clairaudient, and teacher of energy clearing work.His website is:entity attachment-----This post goes out to anyone who can relate to all the energy stealers and emotional vampires,and to the online trolls who are the perfect example.Note to those who use the handles Kittn Power and City Guy herevia anon cl relay email:If you have a REAL beef with someone who has wronged you,REACH THEM IN-PERSON, VIA PHONE, OR DIRECT EMAIL ADDRESSwith REAL NAMES, or speak with a therapist to gain closure.Stop contacting strangers via anon cl relay to dump your baggage.To City Guy, stop trying to get free therapy online where it's not offered.Place your own ad requesting what it is that you needso you connect with someone interested orchoose one of the ads or an online forum which has offered it to youif you really are that desperate for help and have no one to turn to.If you can't take that advice, you will be talking to yourself.Your actions are IN VIOLATION OF PROHIBITED OF TERMS OF USE,AND HAVE YOU CLASSIFIED AS A TROLL.That's the term Administration here uses to refer to an individualwho contacts strangers in an attempt to dupe and/or elicit a negative reactionand drain positive life force and energy.You have been exposed.My life energy has been returned to me for a positive, constructive purpose.Anyone who is malicious or intends to bring me emotional or other harm or painwill have it received tenfold.

The ad he posts looks like this: --I am a guy who has a serious fetish for women's flats. I love to see a woman cross her legs and playfully dangle the flat off of her foot, playing with it. I love it soo much I'm willing to pay upwards of 350$ an hour to schedule a time to watch you do this. We can meet in public (always public for both our concerns) and you can study or whatever and I'll discreetly watch your natural dangle.If you are interested, please be ready to send pictures of your flats (as I need to see if your flats are of my preference) I like older, well worn, used flats btw :) but really I'm a sucker for all ballet/ballerina flats...pointy toe, almond toe... I love them. and please let me know your height/weight, race, and shoe size.Please provide your personal email address as well, as CL emails sometimes get blocked or pinned as SPAM. Thank you and hope to speak soon !!--I needed extra cash and responded to the ad, it sounded extremely simple. First of all, he does not want to meet you in a public cafe, he tried to meet in a movie theatre. I refused and met at a cafe instead. Although his ad calls for discretion and public meeting, he will ask you to move to the most quiet area of the public place, with the least amount of people around. So basically it's just the two of you, separated by about 15ft., with a few passersby now and then. Studying is not really an option as he will ask you to constantly be playing with your flats and tell you you're wasting time otherwise. I never looked him in the face or directly at him, but I am 99% sure he started masturbating right there. Before the end of the hour he asked me to report him to security, and arranged that we'd do the payment by him leaving it in a book, I'd pick it up, and then report him to security afterwards. He communicates via email. In the preliminary email conversation, he outlined the rate for my flats for one hour, and a long list of rules he follows. It very much seemed like a set system he had in place, and that he was looking to do this on a consistent weekly basis. He said he pays at the end of a ""session"" by putting money in an envelope inside a book or magazine, and leaving that next to you. The day of, before the end of the hour, he left abruptly, asked me to meet him back inside the cafe, and then claimed to have been escorted out by security because someone else reported him, all within a 3min time span. He claimed they were calling the police and asked me to leave the building and not speak to anyone, and that he'd email later. After that he gets completely ghost. SO : EITHER DEMAND PAYMENT UPFRONT, OR DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. I should've known better, but let my experience save you from wasting your time.",40.718500,-74.002500,2015-12-14 07:12:13.766613,2015-12-14 07:12:13.766613,detail page

I joined a new band abruptly because I felt I needed a change in my life.. Getting back to play music was the only thing that I knew could make me whole again. You came in with your singer boyfriend. I couldn't even look at you when you introduced yourself to me. I was so nervous because I never saw anyone so beautiful. Time went on and you broke up with him. I was persistent to make you my girlfriend and after a big fight and not talking to you for a few months, I figured it was hopeless. I was destined to be alone. But on New Years Day, I mustered up the courage to just apologize and let my ego go. I invited you to a friend's party and that night we danced to Motown songs on the jukebox after hours. I went home with you and we made the most incredible love. The morning after you made cute pancakes with eggs for eyes and bacon for a smile. Then we laid in bed and shared stories. I talked about my life and told of the deepest, darkest hours and you sat with the eyes of intrigue. You told me that I was honest, genuine human and that you were so glad to have found me. My demons didn't scare you. We shared a lot of things you and I. Two broken spirits made whole by each other's presence. But as time went on, my demons came along to play. You got sick of my depressive states, my lack of empathy, my anger. It was never meant to be that way but as many relationships in the past, I turned a good person that loved me into a broken person that hated me. I destroyed the city we built just like the many cities before. The night we would say goodbye came so quickly, even though it was years later. you were saying you would always love me. I couldn't say anything but I knew that it would be the only time I could because you would be gone and I would be alone with only my head voice to tell me that I fucked up. You moved back to your parent's house in NJ and I saw you once more. I cried like a baby and you hugged me for minutes, which felt like seconds. We said we would love each other to the end and I said ""Don't regret anything"" even though I was lying and I regretted everything. I even regretted meeting you because maybe if I just hadn't we would have been happier and better people.. better friends. You hugged me once more and said ""give us time, we will survive this. Ill always love you and I want to be friends but we just need time."" and you left. I went to my car and cried for an hour. Then my car wouldn't start and I sat in the cold waiting for a tow truck. That was just my karma. I had no points left. They were all used up whenever I screamed at you in anger or shut you out because I had a concrete block in my chest and I couldn't feel anything. I moped for weeks, didn't eat, didn't sleep. Felt sick to my stomach. I was up in mood one day and down the other. Days I felt worse than I ever did. I contemplated taking my own life. But I am too proud for that. I could have, as you know, I had many hunting rifles to choose from. All it took was one key, a choice for what size hole it would make and then good night Irene. But again, I was too proud, just like I was too proud to admit when I was wrong to you or when I spun an argument on you. Also, I felt that it would be selfish of me. Selfish to you, my friends, my family and to the crime scene cleaner. He doesn't want to be cleaning up my struggles, he wants to be home with his kids. I didn't want my family or friends having to clean up my brain matter. No one should do that. So, I sat at night, watching the city pass by. Wondering how many cigarettes I had to smoke before it would kill me.. That would be a fitting end and the coward's way out. I also wondered how many people out there in this big city was feeling like me, or falling in love, or having a baby or dying holding the hand of their loved ones. Whether or not they failed in their lives, was their true love still by their side in the end? Mine surely wouldn't be, I thought. The days passed by faster and faster. Every day I got more nervous. Nervous to see you again. I didn't know if you really meant anything of what you said. Maybe you were just pacifying me or being civil because you were a nice person. Didn't matter how many good times we had, it was the bad that you remembered the most. I, the opposite. I forgot all of your bad moments. But, my bad moments trumped the good moments, they probably stuck around with you.Days grew into months, months into years and I never heard from you. I lived every day hoping that I would see you, even if we didn't become friends. I just wanted to see you, yet I was still nervous. I didn't contact you for 5 years until I mustered up the courage to go to your parent's house. I drove a couple of hours and arrived to find a ""For Sale"" sign on the lawn. I knocked on the door hoping that maybe, just maybe someone would answer, but I peered in the window to find it vacant. I knocked on the neighbor's doors and no answers either, except the mailman called me as he walked by. He asked if I needed help, I looked alarmed. I said no, but if he knew what happened to the people that lived here. He said one died and the other moved to a condo but he didn't remember where. He wasn't very friendly with them. Which boggled me because mailmen that I know, know everyone. So that was 5 years ago from this month. 10 years ago I made the biggest mistake of my life. I have moved on from so many things and forgave myself for more, but I still regret you. I still regret leaving you and doing those things. I regret not trying harder and giving up so easily. I regret not seeking help when you would ask. You kept me going even though I had a hard time showing it. I have no idea where you are, why you never contacted me. Well, maybe a slight idea. But did my every so often bad really outweigh that amazing connection we had? We used to joke that we were the couple against all odds. We got together after a big fight. After you told me I was friendzoned. We loved sharing that story with people, we were proud. Our love couldn't be broken as we so thought. We were so naive then. The 5 years I spent with you were the best 5 years of my entire life. You knew that, I knew that. I never married, had kids or anything. I was successful in my career, because that's what kept me from going crazy after we ended. I just worked at that because I didn't want to fail yet another thing I loved. I would have given anything to go back and start over. 10 years have gone, if you are out there, just give me 10 minutes, because I can't live another 10 years without knowing where you are or how your life is. I love you forever. - H",40.7694255,-73.9631934,2015-12-14 07:13:39.208652,2015-12-14 07:13:39.208652,Google Places API

The people you know and other strangers who get to see you are all real lucky. Were you headed to Queens? Because let me tell you straight up, you are the Queen of Looking Good! I have never in my life posted one of these things to this creepy website. If you were somehow glad to sit near me for some insane reason I would be delighted to meet you! It would be cool to go on a nice date or just get to meet the mystery. I can only assume you are spoken for or above reading Craigslist MC's.

I smiled at you in passing, and found myself looking back more than once. Neither of us spoke for the longest time, but it felt as if we had been deep in conversation for hours. You asked me my name, I told you. As we shook hands, I found that I was lost in your gaze. Here you were, a complete stranger yet as my fingers found the lines of yours, they lingered there for the longest time. I laughed and looked away shyly. I hated how much power you had over me, and loved it all the same. We were interrupted and I took the distraction as a sign. Shaking my nerves, I dove into conversation with everyone around me but you. Still I felt your gaze, and couldn't help looking over to see if your face was as I remembered. Your eyes smiled and looked away, leaving me ever more curious. A dark corner is where you led me. Everyone had left, and the invisible pull I was feeling became so strong that I swore I could see its color. I tried to act oblivious but you saw right through it. As you pulled me close to you, I looked away. Afraid of how I felt in that moment. Afraid of what you might see in my eyes. Lightly I felt the warmth of your lips caress my shoulder, lightly they worked their way to my neck. You said ""Look at me."", and I knew it was over. I knew that if I looked, then there would be no going back. Part of me wanted to run in that moment. Leave you standing there in the dark, alone. I didn't, I allowed myself to accept the pull, give in to the curiosity. You gave me your number, and told me you'd call. ""Don't make plans."" you said, in a way that sounded like you meant for forever. As if you knew that I would never need anyone else again. I laughed, and watched you walk away.

I was on the six train one time and I was sleepy , this is a true story by the way, I usually have my melancholy face on even while asleep on the train, don't worry I know my stops and pay attention to the streets so I don't get off the wrong stop(happened to me twice/three times in the night in my past lol), the person sitting next to whoever she/he was, I scooched over to where that person had gotten up from, while I scooched over I noticed someone across from me had scooched along with me (pretty funny but yeah) I looked up, and saw a beautiful cute Asian women smiling at me and shit. In my head I was wondering, why the hell is she staring at me?, I couldn't help but look back, as I kept looking, she smiled more at me, I've grown to think maybe she likes me and started blushing uncontrollably, I'm a punk, I'm so shy to talk to her, so instead of saying ""Hello"" I took out my lighter that had a nice rose and skull artwork drawn onto the plastic as a distraction to not look at her. She got on I believe maybe 23 or 28 street station and got off at 110 street and ever since I couldn't stop thinking about her and we would have maybe been in a one year anniversary. My thoughts on her has been of the naughty as of late, I never had experienced a girl before but I would kiss her, lick her everywhere, and love her until the end of time or if she gets bored of me and or cheats, it happens eh lol...Now this was copied and pasted from my page on fetlife, if anyone that is Asian and happened to read all of this, than I thank you for doing so.

I am very sorry. It was Friday night, October 23rd, probably going into Saturday, October 24th. You were on the subway with your friend (another girl), but you caught my eye. I'm pretty sure I was never so infatuated in my life. Your laugh, your black leather jacket, your jeans, just your general kindness... I still can't get it out of my head. I followed you around like a little puppy-dog, totally lost in the moment, no idea where I was, other than that I was with you. Your friend left, looking at your longingly as she either transferred to another subway or got off (I'm not sure), giving you the, ""Will-you-be-ok?""-eyes, and you gave her the ""it's-ok-he's-harmless""-nod. I am sorry to even think that I took advantage of your trust, that I tried to buy your company. I was stupid, not in my right mind, and thought that I was hot shit in my blue suede shoes, navy jacket, slim fit khaki pants, pink shirt with white skinny tie. Little did I know how much it would eat away at me, the fact that we had a special moment in time, and I ruined it with such a cheap question...""I hate that it has to come to this, but how about a hundred dollars? Two hundred? Three?"" I literally wish I could go back in time and punch myself in the face so hard. I think you slapped me...I'm not sure. But I totally deserved it. If I had to reach down really deeply into my soul and think about it, I'd say that we both enjoyed that time together...the seemingly eternal yet infinitesimal space in time that paralleled the opening and closing of the subway doors, going up the escalator and my crouching down, to see you kind of amused, kind of scared... I am sorry to have scared you. I am sorry I was an asshole. I hope that you forgive me. And if, by some miracle, you actually see this or your friend that was with us sees this and passes it on to you, and if, by an even greater miracle, you reply to it, I just want to say this: if I could've changed any one thing, instead of things ending the way they did, I would've finished by asking you, ""Well, how about you let me cook you and your kids breakfast? I'm stranded, can crash on your floor, and will be up early to go get some eggs and pancakes and it'll be good; I'm great with kids."" You would've said, ""That is very sweet, but I will have to take a raincheck on that one."" We would've smiled longingly, as I hugged you goodbye.I am sorry. All the flowers in the world would not do justice to the type of apology I have for you, and one day, I hope that this message is somehow conveyed to you, the positive karmic vibrations sent through the universe SOMEhow... either through the kindness of another or a very lucky day, your kids doing really well in school (because I pray for them and you now), or you winning the lottery...SOMEhow...and I hope that even if you will most likely never know the good fortune may have occurred due to my prayers, you will feel happy enough to forgive all those that have wronged you or upset you, all in that one moment.",40.731300,-73.989200,2015-12-14 07:16:28.513096,2015-12-14 07:16:28.513096,detail page

4291,5351234533,Guy who gave me the ticket for the 1975 at Terminal 5 - w4m,2015-12-08 15:08,/mnh/mis/5351234533.html,mnh,w4m,Midtown West,"I'm going to start this off the same way every one else does, I can't believe I am writing in here!I am looking for the guy who gave me a concert ticket to the 1975 at Terminal 5 on Friday, after I scalped one on the corner and it was a fake ticket and I couldn't get in. I thanked you and offered you a drink, and in excitement ran into the show, but I wish I would have hung around for a bit. Your kind gesture meant more than you will ever know or intended. Spotify just notified me that I listened to the song Girls by the 1975 seven hundred sixty times this year. When I first moved to New York from a small-ish town, I was on my own and knew no one. The chaos and craziness happening around me was so intimidating at first, I would find myself panicked and nervous all the time. I would put that song on in my headphones, and the cheerful tune would make me feel calm, content, and safe. I would forget what was happening around me. That song helped me overcome my fears and become comfortable in my environment. When I heard they were coming, and that it sold out so quickly, I was devastated because I wanted to be there and hear the song live... to remind me of what I was able to overcome and share a little moment with myself. :) So I know you probably were just being a nice guy and didn't intend to change anyones life, but your gesture really meant so, so much to me. You turned the worst night ever into the BEST NIGHT EVER! I've already paid it forward, but I want to pay it back to you. Let me take you out for a drink!

I was always very kind and considerate and tender as well with her. she says that she struggles with commitment because she's been independent for so long and had to raise her children as a single mother. I never asked her to give up control I've never asked you for anything but to love me. and she told me she would forever..... I do not know how to take the hurt that I'm feeling that I don't know how to deal with the pain that I'm feeling, how can somebody say that they love you as deeply as they do and they only want you forever and the next moment change their mind because they're afraid of commitment to me??? I'm a good man are very good man yes I've made mistakes in my past and yes a not so good past but it's the past. my actions speak different then my past I work, as a heavy equipment operator except I'm laid off right now from work but I'm looking everyday to find full time employment. she can support herself, as well as her children & I do not ask for any money from her. the relationship has never ever been about money. and only about love with one another and for one another. the relationship has been good, the relationship was beautiful. I have truly never met a woman that I can honestly say has been so good to me and so loving towards me and with me in my heart is aching so bad I don't know what to do to help the pain go away. I asked to talk to her since she gave the ring back she said she would, and then she changed her mind again. I asked her if we could meet for a cup of coffee and just talk or I would take her out for dinner as well. she said she wasn't in the mood to go out for dinner because she had a long day at work. she said that I could come over and grab a pizza and bring it with me. I ordered the pizza and not five minutes later she told me to forget it she didn't want to. I took her the Pizza anyhow I didn't knock on the door I left a Pizza on the picnic table by her back door and sent her a text message and told her and her children to enjoy the pizza and where it was. when she had a problem in her house with the plumbing I took care to come back as late as 11 o'clock at night to see that I could get the drains are clogged so that she could have a shower in the morning before work when our laundry came up missing at the laundromat I followed through with that as well with numerous phone calls and I found her laundry when they said they didn't have it and that will be returned to her tomorrow. I've done everything right to make the relationship healthy and happy and safe and loving. why do I have to hurt the way I hurt right now??? Has God forsaken me for some reason??? Is anyone knows the answer or can tell me how I can get the love of my life back please, please tell me what I can do to seek God's forgiveness for anything that I may have done to somebody, and please tell me how do I get the love of my life to stay in a committed relationship with me as well as take the engagement ring back and put it back on her finger???????

You were a free Pro Se attorney there and gave me advice on how to deal with her (in the Resource Room/Help Center, room 404 I believe). I remember you being kind of angry and bossy and impatient, not at me, just in general, like the job was driving you crazy. I could understand, given the circumstances and the ghetto, thuggish crowd you mostly deal with there (on that particular day I saw you, a black man with dreads in the elevator threatened to ""shoot up the place"" because he didn't want to wait on line anymore and you called Security on him... another time I went a 20 something female accused some 70 year old woman of ""flirting with her man"" just because the older lady said excuse me as they formed a queue/line, and the young woman then threatened to beat her up. Ridiculous stuff like that.. You were one of the most intense people I've ever met...You were impeccably dressed in a navy blue suit, a fit white male with dark, dark brown hair and beautiful cheekbones to match intensely blue eyes. There's nothing sexier than a man bossin' a woman around. I need a man like that- one who is 'in charge' and in touch with his masculinity. Naturally dominant, no props needed... Let me stroke that hair and those cheekbones and melt you down... I'm a swf (white), 5 ft 7, 35 years old, with long auburn colored hair, curvy where it counts (back and front), very busty, green eyes. Stereotypical artist/bohemian type ( a singer, among many other things). You looked about 35-40 back in 2007, so I'm assuming you're about 40-47 years old now..",40.622500,-73.965000,2015-12-22 11:31:51.984449,2015-12-22 11:31:51.984449,detail page

I was in Berlin 9/15-17 or so, so sometime then. I was just walking around and I asked you for directions, because I was truly confused about where to go. I then noticed how cute you are and asked you where you're from. You said you were from Chile. But you seemed to speak English with an American accent. You had long, tight, curly blond hair in a pony tail, and huge blue eyes. I llloooooovvvveeee your hair sooooo much. Quite unique, luxurious looking even.

I don't normally go for younger guys either, you would be the first time I did. Check out this song (on Spotify), it's how I feel about you... let's sing this together...

Our final glimpse of each other was as you walked up the stairs, which I strategically placed myself underneath, looking up at you from below between your legs. I would so love to do just that but in true closest, hottest proximity. It honestly looked like you were thinking the same thing I was. I realize the chances of you thinking to check here are about as slim as winning the lottery, nevertheless it just dawned on me to give it a try. I've never done it before, and I just regret not having gone up the stairs after you and at least given you my card.

To some it is a need or a simple relaxing ""bonus"" pleasure, to get off and release after a good workout like it is to sit in the steam room/sauna. But as they say it is kind of hit or miss for most of you. Proof of the fact, that the missed connection section on CL is so full of ads. Most of the guys who are really horny and are lucky enough to find that days most hottest guy to fool around with, go home, or back to work pissed off, if the opportunity didn't present itself to the full extent they wanted. Here is where I come in with the comic part. I will recount today's observation of events at NYSC Park Slope from my point of view and you go ahead and take the pointers anyway you want, but my goal is to make you see the comedy of it all and instead of going home pissed make a joke out of it, and maybe you'll behave differently while cruising at the gym next time. Most of the guys cruising expect a drama free, quick, anonymous hookup with no hassle. But in fact the subconscious mind games going on is so freakin dramatic, like women are. I spent a couple of hours and this is what I took in. At times there were 4-8 people in the steam room or sauna, all of them wanting the same thing, ""instant gratification for little Johnny""! One guy might be into 2 or 3 others, yet he is waiting for another to leave the room. Almost no one has the guts to start the action, everyone looking around to wait for that specific person/s to leave and for someone to start playing with themselves. One guy runs out from the steam room hoping to get the sauna empty, all for himself, and hoping that only the guy/s will follow suite, or vice versa. Another runs out cause he can't handle the heat any longer. Others sit silently and try to will this guy out with their mind. People measure hotness and then become disappointed. I've seen guys with big bulges sticking out of their towel only to produce a 6-6.5, at the most, inch cock, while other with no bulge hide an 8-9 inch pecker beneath that towel. Many hot muscle guys have small cocks, while others not that hot looking have huge cocks. But people forget that books shouldn't be judged by its cover. I've seen a guy running away from another cause he wasn't into his looks, but at one point he caught a glimpse of his hard-on and decided to compromise.Guys don't realize how many times they could have a 6-10 people group jerk, oral, and more, while still choosing who they want to play with in the room. Instead some guys who think they are gods gifts, and they might be handsome, end up going home pissed, without any release, even though they are so perfectly hot, yet their ego, and picky attitude is their own downfall, for no pleasure. I don't blame them, trolls can be blamed just as well. Some might think, hey you are probably a troll complaining, but that is so far from the truth. I have had more hits then misses at the gym wet areas, for two reasons. First of all, I don't take it seriously. People might see me burst out laughing thinking that I'm crazy, while seeing the situation just makes me smile and laugh. Taking it easy, makes it all the more easier. Secondly, I know that there is no such thing as 100% perfection in this world. Very rarely does someone hookup with the perfect guy, in the perfect setting, with the perfect scenario. So once you are aware that the perfect moment will probably not present itself, one makes the best out of the current situation.I'm actually a nice guy who will not stalk a person if the signs are clear that they are not interested, I will walk in the opposite direction and give the guy his room to play. If for instance I walk in upon some guy fooling around, I will tell them to carry on and not mind me, cause the sooner they have their pleasure the sooner they'll be out of my way. But in reality most people are not like that, they tend to be selfish.I would recommend trolls to loosen up and not try to get something that they clearly will not get, why should the young hot guys not have pleasure because of your selfishness. Vice versa as well, you hot hunk/jock have fun in the room with the guy of your liking and let the other person not so hot feast his eyes and jerk off, without letting him touch you. You'll end up being satisfied and so will they.Guys have fun, make sure to have a lookout. Take it easy, see the comic part of it, and enjoy life and let others do the same. Good luck to y'all, and a happy New Year. ",40.666900,-73.982800,2015-12-28 03:52:06.430274,2015-12-28 03:52:06.430274,detail page

We've been there for each other through the happiest days, the hardest moments and, you know, we're that much the better for it. Once, decades ago, back in high school, you held my head and ran your fingers through my hair when I had too much to drink at that summer party senior year when we were busy marking the beginning of our futures with bright hopeful exclamations. Twice, I've driven like mad into Brooklyn at the drop of a hat to pull you from the depths of that clawing depression that closes in around you when you find yourself trembling with fear at the questions you ask yourself- if you've done the right things with your life, made the right choices. I remember when you guided me home that night my psychosis came back and I found myself lost in some dim corner of an East Village bar with my mind transforming the entire pulsing city into a weapon and the Saturday crowds whispering hallucinatory nothings that swirled around me like so much hateful smoke. And I've been there for you through the pain of walking backwards along the path of your own footprints, wondering if you're ever going to go somewhere, if you'll ever escape that corporate purgatory that makes your stomach turn or rise from the dull glow of that nameless oblivion that you wish your music will one day lift you out of. We've saved each other a thousand times. We've laughed together a thousand more. We've spent entire nights talking about the things we'd never share with anyone else. We've shared a thousand meals and wondered simultaneously at a thousand ancient questions. It began as a tiny twinkle somewhere. It grew and grew until I couldn't ignore it. And I remember the exact moment when I realized that I love you more than anything else in this universe and all the parallel universes too. There was classical music on the radio and it was autumn. In one crystalline second everything just clicked into place as if all the stars fell from the sky into my cupped hands which I held out like a beggar's bowl. But I didn't want to destroy what we had so instead, I wrote you a love letter which I kept in my jacket pocket for years, half waiting for the right moment to give it to you and half keeping it with me with the intention of never giving it, just letting it smolder there somewhere near my heart where it belonged. There was even one night when I reached for a cigarette and the envelope crinkled and you asked me what I had in there. I muttered something about receipts and looked at my shoes. When the moment actually came, when I built up the courage and you read my letter, you knew you could never love me back. It's just the way things are. I guess you just don't get to pick who your heart belongs to. And so we chose to stay friends. And I refused to bring it up ever again because I'd rather swallow my heart than lose you as a friend, or pressure you, or make you uncomfortable. I suppose I've always loved you, and I always will. More than I can describe in any letter. More than you could ever know. But a part of you does know- and I think we both wish things could be different, but they can't - and sometimes the sadness of it threatens to pull me apart bone by bone. Sometimes, when we smile at each other, I can almost pretend we are together. And so I write this to you knowing you will never see it. I should forget you. I should leave and never look back. But I can't. Because last week when you called me sobbing hysterically and I went on the rescue mission of my lifetime to lift you up from the darkness that had crept up from the edges of your life I realized that my love for you, although it can never be returned, does make a difference. And I want you to know, when you worry about nobody loving you, when those whispers of despair worm their way into your mind, that as long as I am here you will never be unloved. We may grow apart eventually. We'll marry other people and have long lives in distant places. But I will always love you the most. And this city will remember, long after we are both gone. It's soaked into the streets. It's floating above the waters. It's drifting between the brownstones. It's etched, in a subtle but forever way, into the grand history of New York.

I finally started that thing I told you about, things are looking up. There's a really good chance I get something around here, if not then somewhere else. For some crazy reason, there was apart of me that wished you were here, to enjoy this with me, but then I remembered what you did and came to understand that I am better off without you. I am aiming high on this, know that what happened back then is going to pose a roadblock. Unlike the times before, though, I am optimistic about a better result. It was a mistake, a mistake I'll never make again. I was lost and confused, like plenty of times before. I let someone else get the better of me. It has changed now, could give a fuck less about a lot of things. I have direction, know what I want and where to go. I am not going to be concerned whether things work out or not, just try. All I can do is try, man. Last Christmas, it was the first time I felt good about the holiday season in a long time. I guess it had to do with the fact that I've disassociated myself from the consumerist temptations that it brings, no longer give it meaning the way most people do. It's just another day to me, nothing more, nothing less. For the longest time, I found myself getting depressed. It was the same routine for me: Stay in my room, eat with the family then quickly leave the table, visit my aunt and cousin, and when the ball was ready to drop on New Year's Eve, watch it with mom. I felt kind of stupid that I ever let it bother me, but I don't have the same empty feeling in my stomach that I used to feel, like I'd never find love. It used to bother me, a lot, watching couples hold hands while my own shadow follows me everywhere I go. Seeing people kiss each other as they say, ""Merry Christmas"" or, ""Happy New Year's."" Trying to watch holiday movies or seeing commercials on the TV didn't make me feel any better, all it did was sink me further down, lower and lower into my emotional despair. I don't know what it was, can't say there was a startling revelation. Last year, I woke up feeling. . .. . . happy. That morning I went for a walk, reliving the times of my youth when I used to do the same thing: visiting friends, thinking about the stuff I received for Christmas, or trying to clear my head because I got too high the night before. Lol, it was usually a combination of the three. I looked all around me, absorbed the scenery. I said to myself: ""This is what it means to be happy--be in the moment.""I never cared for much in this world. I have to admit, from time to time, I wasn't always happy with the simple things. It can be troublesome when you have less than others, or when. . .. . ..Whatever, nevermind. ",40.8778835,-73.8911033,2015-12-28 03:53:09.460014,2015-12-28 03:53:09.460014,Google Places API

Sometimes I wish I could go back six months in time to that late June night, and re-experience the peace that washed over me when my true feelings were revealed. I felt secure and confident in being able to move on from you, with that massive weight lifted off my shoulders. That all went to shit when the wheels started turning again, switching on the vicious cycle my heart has suffered for a year and a half. Mutually felt or not, this battle is no longer worth fighting.

I smiled at you in passing, and found myself looking back more than once. Neither of us spoke for the longest time, but it felt as if we had been deep in conversation for hours. You asked me my name, I told you. As we shook hands, I found that I was lost in your gaze. Here you were, a complete stranger yet as my fingers found the lines of yours, they lingered there for the longest time. I laughed and looked away shyly. I hated how much power you had over me, and loved it all the same. We were interrupted and I took the distraction as a sign. Shaking my nerves, I dove into conversation with everyone around me but you. Still I felt your gaze, and couldn't help looking over to see if your face was as I remembered. Your eyes smiled and looked away, leaving me ever more curious. A dark corner is where you led me. Everyone had left, and the invisible pull I was feeling became so strong that I swore I could see its color. I tried to act oblivious but you saw right through it. As you pulled me close to you, I looked away. Afraid of how I felt in that moment. Afraid of what you might see in my eyes. Lightly I felt the warmth of your lips caress my shoulder, lightly they worked their way to my neck. You said ""Look at me."", and I knew it was over. I knew that if I looked, then there would be no going back. Part of me wanted to run in that moment. Leave you standing there in the dark, alone. I didn't, I allowed myself to accept the pull, give in to the curiosity. You gave me your number, and told me you'd call. ""Don't make plans."" you said, in a way that sounded like you meant for forever. As if you knew that I would never need anyone else again. I laughed, and watched you walk away.

The usual awkward interaction, and honestly I had no idea that I'd ever see you again. We spoke about the typical, boring, topics, but somehow you make me laugh through it all. I notice more about you as the conversation goes on, and tell you that you 'Look like someone I know'. You tell me that you get that a lot, and I just roll my eyes and laugh. It's getting late, and we both are fighting the inevitable. Finally, you give in and I realized that if you leave, I don't want to stay. I tell you that maybe I'll see you around. When all the while, I know that I have to see you again. Across the room I see you. I'm watching you smile, nod, and then you catch my eye. Did you notice that I was watching? Or was the moment short enough that I had escaped? Brushing it off, I enjoy the evening; acting as if you're just anyone else in that room full of buzzing conversation and distant laughter. Drink in hand, I turn. There you are, there I am, and here we are. Face to face with no escape. You smile, and say something about my hair. I smile, annoyed at how excited I am to finally speak to you, yet doing everything I can to hide any sign of that. You ask me how I am, and so begins this conversation we've already had. Silence falls, and with the softest touch you lead me outside. Without a word, I follow. Knowing deep down that I want this moment I've played so many times in mind. Brushing my hair lightly from my face, you pull me in and kiss me. ""I'm leaving"", you say. My heart sinks, but I fight the urge to show it.

I am very sorry. It was Friday night, October 23rd, probably going into Saturday, October 24th. We were on the ""n"" train. You were on the subway with your friend (another girl), but you caught my eye. I'm pretty sure I was never so infatuated in my life. Your laugh, your black leather jacket, your jeans, just your general kindness... I still can't get it out of my head. I followed you around like a little puppy-dog, totally lost in the moment, no idea where I was, other than that I was with you. Your friend left, looking at your longingly as she either transferred to another subway or got off (I'm not sure), giving you the, ""Will-you-be-ok?""-eyes, and you gave her the ""it's-ok-he's-harmless""-nod. I am sorry to even think that I took advantage of your trust, that I tried to buy your company. I was stupid, not in my right mind, and thought that I was hot shit in my blue suede shoes, navy jacket, slim fit khaki pants, pink shirt with white skinny tie. Little did I know how much it would eat away at me, the fact that we had a special moment in time, and I ruined it with such a cheap question...""I hate that it has to come to this, but how about a hundred dollars? Two hundred? Three?"" I literally wish I could go back in time and punch myself in the face so hard. I think you slapped me...I'm not sure. But I totally deserved it. If I had to reach down really deeply into my soul and think about it, I'd say that we both enjoyed that time together...the seemingly eternal yet infinitesimal space in time that paralleled the opening and closing of the subway doors, going up the escalator and my crouching down, to see you kind of amused, kind of scared... I am sorry to have scared you. I am sorry I was an asshole. I hope that you forgive me. And if, by some miracle, you actually see this or your friend that was with us sees this and passes it on to you, and if, by an even greater miracle, you reply to it, I just want to say this: if I could've changed any one thing, instead of things ending the way they did, I would've finished by asking you, ""Well, how about you let me cook you and your kids breakfast? I'm stranded, can crash on your floor, and will be up early to go get some eggs and pancakes and it'll be good; I'm great with kids."" You would've said, ""That is very sweet, but I will have to take a raincheck on that one."" We would've smiled longingly, as I hugged you goodbye.I am sorry. All the flowers in the world would not do justice to the type of apology I have for you, and one day, I hope that this message is somehow conveyed to you, the positive karmic vibrations sent through the universe SOMEhow... either through the kindness of another or a very lucky day, your kids doing really well in school (because I pray for them and you now), or you winning the lottery...SOMEhow...and I hope that even if you will most likely never know the good fortune may have occurred due to my prayers, you will feel happy enough to forgive all those that have wronged you or upset you, all in that one moment.",40.7127837,-74.0059413,2015-12-28 03:53:48.135641,2015-12-28 03:53:48.135641,Google Places API

His continued posts seem like a game or to an imagined person or relationshipor someone unavailable with another life who has no intention of being with him or doesn't even care or know he exists. These are placed in New York. It's unlikely that we're speaking of some woman in a third world country, because why then would she be reading MC for New York?!It seems to be going on a half year or a year now.. and some girls read these and want to believe it may be for them. It's all delusional.If a guy is truly pining for a woman, he'd be sending her flowers,he'd be emailing and writing her letters directly. He'd be speaking to her on the phone,he'd be visiting her and sending her planet tickets if they're long distance. He'd be keepingbusy and working his arse off so he can make sure they can be together soon.He'd get an answer if she's interested or not. He wouldn't be blindly pining.He wouldn't accept excuses as to why she is unable to be with him or he'd move on.If she's married or involved with someone else and is unavailable, then what he is doing is just dysfunctional and unhealthy, becauseplacing ads saying I miss you or I love you on a daily or multiple timesa day basis is not the same as actually investing the real time, effort and expenseinto a relationship where there's genuine give and take between two people. One is real life and the other is like a romantic story someone makes up in his mind to not feel alone, but while he's doing this he's allowing his real life to just pass by day after day while he dreams of a love he doesn't have and likely never will if he keeps doing what he's doing. Dude, it's almost the New Year.If you want real love, find real love.Stop pining for an unrequited love with someone you can't be with,can't write to, can't speak to directly all in REAL LIFE.

4924,5374612307,You enjoy serving a woman,2015-12-25 17:17,/lgi/mis/5374612307.html,lgi,man,Upper East,"I first learned of such a general lifestyle here when noticing ads by men offering to serve women. I also had a former roommate in college dabble in such thingsand have never forgotten the scenes I had watched on cable TV while babysitting as a young girl. It's been years since I've had a true full-time servant. The right fit is so imperative that the wrong fit makes it anenergy zapping nightmare where you'd hope you just had the time and energy to do it all yourself . On the other hand, the genuine lifestyle servant who sees it as his mission and purpose or a form of escape and ablution to serve a woman, a professional,together woman, with goals, aspirations and dreams whose priorities just don't place an interest or emphasis on manual and domestic labor,makes for an ideal fit. You get to do what you enjoy which is serve an intelligent, assertive, and confident woman who knows what she wants,and I get what I need which is someone genuine to handle the minutiae.I've always gravitated toward those applicants who have the means orgenuinely seek to sacrifice to place me before themselves. It's not that I'm unable to reimburse. I would never place my welfare in the hands of a stranger where I have no options. That's not my definition of power.It's just that having someone genuine to dote on and pamper me fulfills a needand frees up my time and focus to do the things I enjoy. This isn't meant to be twist your arm, drama-ridden, disrespectful interaction, it's meant for the genuine, sweet, kind man who gets it and who views doing all that he can for a woman as G-d's work. Please don't use terms like ""Mistress"" or you will be disqualified. I just don't relate to the ""label"". It's not my thing. If you're looking to deliberately mess up in order to be talked down to and abused or to trigger negative fits of rage or upset, then we will not be a good fit. If you're seeking such radical interaction, I view this as ""roleplay"" for which a timemust be scheduled and a tribute must be proferred. I do not mix my real life where things must be done with game-playing scripts. It's just not me and never will be. Do not mix apples and oranges. If you apply with misleading or malicious intent, this will be considered fraud to be handled by my legal team. I refuse to give my energy to clowns. Include a detailed breakdown of all of your professional and life's skills in a resume or detailed cover letter, and why I should choose you. Please be sincere, efficient, generous, genuine, meticulous and know that this is your place.Ability to chauffeur or cover the driver, a plus. General financial freedom preferred. No time for games or playing psychic.If you apply, you will be evaluated based on your actions.If your talk is big, but you have yet to establish a proven positive track record of actions,then consider your talk worthless until I know for a fact that your word is solid. What can I say? The good men in my life talked less and did more. The good men in my life made life seem easy. The good men inspired me. You want to see me happy. You enjoy knowing that I'm happy.

We both had never meet another person that we instantly felt like we had known forever. You loved Aaliyah, the Yankees, and chamomile tea. You loved reading and told me you would be surrounded with Orchids at all times if it were possible. You teased me about being a silly country boy who was much too proud of the bad Spanish he picked up during Peace Corps service and found my love of 90's New York hip hop amusing for someone that had grown up on a road named after a part of a farm animal's anatomy. I teased you about your obsession with the discontinued Johnson's Body Care - Melt Away Stress Lavender & Chamomile Body Wash and the tattoo you got on your right hip at twenty that read ""fire and ice"" in Chinese characters.

Truth is though that I have been with my fair share of women. So this feeling is genuine, I know u will never read this but there is still a shimmering light of hope that u will. U are gorgeous but more importantly strong, smart and very different at least to what I am used to. I appreciate the indirect hello and like I stated on Skout I didn't come over to say hello when I spotted u in your neighborhood because it would have been awkward. Just know that u cross my mind constantly and I hope u are well and promoted. Wish u the best my Asian dream.",40.7127837,-74.0059413,2015-12-28 03:56:48.021167,2015-12-28 03:56:48.021167,Google Places API

We dig for so much information regarding the idea of love, we weren't meant for all that - we were simply to meant to feel.Anyway, I am writing to someone from the United Kingdom because I feel like talking with someone far, far away from me.

I remember feeling so many unfamiliar things and it didn't make sense to me. I couldn't put it together quickly enough. Nothing ever felt that good, ever. But I needed to ""grow up"" a good deal to understand what was happening. We both could have handled it better. Our dysfunction begins and ends with this electronic nonsense, which has nothing to do with who we are or could be.I fell in love with who you are not what you have or could be--not even the pretty packaging. Time and circumstances change our appearance, but you will never cease to be the best looking guy I've ever seen no matter what. It took a while to start to know you, and that man is still there. I know you have mental issues, maybe health issues. From experience I know being Superman comes with serious health effects.In the face of plausible deniability, I turn to the evidence. No one goes to the lengths you have to maintain contact without a longing and desire that is intense. The computer, phone, c_______s, even more. I hide everything I can because that's not how you should know me. Perhaps I scare you because I'm the real deal; but nothing about you scares me. The desire and longing is there between us--interacting normally would sort it out the way it should. I long for all aspects including that in which you have experience and I have pent-up demand. There is no compatibility issue there. We met for a reason--what were the odds. Because of our differences we bring different cards to the table, and they happen to complete each others hand.I want you to feel that high, that light, that surge again. Trust me enough to let me decide what is an issue for me and what is not. (and quit trying to give me away like an unwanted cat). I will never believe the choreographed nonsense posted here that creates false everything. Only real conversation, real everything.Just a footnote--I needed your help to put together that desk.

Doesnt matter.. All my relationships were with my own age group.. Yet last gf was 21 and I am late 50s. We were together as a couple for 3 years. She was tired of guys her age who only wanted her for the physical, then left her. She wanted someone more Mature who would truly take time to get to know her as a person. Someone Older who would listen to her thoughts, feelings, respect, care for her.And romantically, someone more Mature who would take time for warmth, affection, Tenderness.

Doesnt matter.. all my life was in relationships with my age.. yet last gf was 21 and I am late 50s. We were together as a couple for 3 years. She was tired of guys her age who only wanted her for the physical, then left her. She wanted someone more Mature who would truly take time to get to know her as a person. Someone Older who would listen to her thoughts, feelings, respect, care for her.And romantically, someone more Mature who would take time for warmth, affection, Tenderness. Someone who would go slow---hold hands, cuddle, be gentle.That is why it worked.. and why it PROVES when it comes to age it is truly just a number.

Our final glimpse of each other was as you walked up the stairs, which I strategically placed myself underneath, looking up at you from below between your legs.

I've never done it before, and I just regret not having gone up the stairs after you and at least given you my card.

As you were unloading your items on the conveyor belt to check out, a drunk standing behind you watched as you placed the items in front of the cashier. While the cashier was ringing up your purchases, the drunk calmly stated, ""You must be Very Single."" You were a bit startled by this proclamation, but you were intrigued by the derelict's intuition, since you are indeed single. You looked at your six items on the belt and saw nothing particularly unusual about your selections that could have tipped off the drunk to your marital status. Curiosity getting the better of you, you said ""Well, you know what, you're absolutely correct. But how on earth did you know that?""

All you really know how to do is read, get hurt because your desperation causes you to be gullible, finally, it causes you to be miserable which causes you to resort to placing ads on craigslist (fucking craigslist, to make friends and find dates; anonymity my foot).

I'm actually invested in MY marriage, which is why I'm here and it's not for the same reason as you are. You are here because you can't find anything better. I can and have, but alas, I am here. I have a ton of friends. All of which are now married and we all do group hang outs. My husband does not feel comfy with me hanging out with my single friends.You're just a little bit of nothing who doesn't understand how relationships work. I went out, had a life, partied far more than you ever have or could imagine in places you couldn't even dream about. I didn't waste my time on the trash you wasted your time on, however. You partied with the worst kinds of people. You know, the gutter trash that has caused you the emotional damage that you currently possess. God knows how disease infested you are. You'd die if you experienced what I have experienced. Now that you're all fat and have fucked everybody in the ghetto, you're trying to find white collar white men because you have a Service job in Manhattan? All fancy now? Doesn't work that way, asshole. You're not attractive enough to pull it off. An ugly, out of shape bitch like you would require one hell of an education and career for that. Sorry, you're shit out of luck, busy beaver. My husband wants to make it work with me. He does not want me leaving him for another man especially because a moron like you became the thorn in our ass and caused me to look elsewhere. That's what it seems like you are.

Please find out if your ""nerdyish"" or if you are dating or are married to a somewhat ""urban"" type guy who might be frequenting Craigslist singles behind your back if he is talking to her. She is ridiculous and ruthless. She will stand in front of your spouses building to catch a glimpse. She will follow you and/or him around because she thinks ""she got this"". These are the words she uses when she is trying to get your guy to do something bad. Please nip it in the bud when you catch wind of this. She claims to be tall, but i'd say she's short to average at best. She's overweight. She has dark cork screw curls cut right to her shoulders and the top of her head is dyed a very unnatural red which is fading out.

My childish infatuation for her preceded all infatuations to come, growing through the steps of hope, patience, disillusionment, and despair before finally resolving into a permanent patina of melancholy over my days. Her unlikely arrival into my life somehow explained, somehow prefigured, my terminal indecision, my inexplicable reluctance to grasp at the love I've wanted - and feared - so desperately. That fear - the strongest when it has mattered the most - hasn't stopped me from hurting others and, especially, myself, my own soul and psyche. You can only blame the culture so much. The fault is in me, in what she revealed in me: I have only wanted the image, the icon of love, always held at a safe distance, more than the real stuff of it. Just as I have only allowed myself the simple pleasures of the body and recoiled at the true gifts of the body, with all the suffering and sacrifice that they entail.I flatter myself that I sabotage myself out of a noble impulse to protect the innocent. And so she was, true, if not exactly innocent, at least protected from what we would have been, even while being deprived of what we both know - knew - that we should have been.

The soul of humans is something that can be taken or given away or stolen. The act of ""soul stealing"" is a common phenomenon among people in relationships where one person is a dominating or power taking person.People also have what is called an energy field or aura . A common problem that most people have is that somewhere in life they became dis-connected to their own personal power or soul and because of this they have become dependent on the energy of other people. The term ""Energy vampire"", or ""Psychic Vampire"" is often a misunderstood term, but it is basically a person who lives and feeds off the life force or energy of other people. The ""energy vampire"" person is actually unable to develop their own energy, and in turn they have to go ""outside"" of themselves to get energy. The main cause of energy stealing or feeding is a lack of connection to ones own personal power or soul, for if you had a connection to yourself on a deeper level you would have no need to use other people for energy. It is extremely common among humans although only a few people are actually aware of it, in terms of having to protect their own energy from being stolen or used by others. On a deeper level, the act of taking or using someone else's energy is based on having power over another person, and it is a lower level of consciousness that people have chosen to operate under.A common belief is that energy vampires are negative people or use negativity to drain you, although this is not true. Someone can take your energy just by you speaking to them, listening to them speak, looking at them, or being close to them in terms of space, (like if you were to stand very close to another person). It has nothing to do with being negative, it has to do with a person who is on a lower vibration energetically, and just by dealing with them, your energy is taken.What is even more interesting is most people who take or use other people's energy, do not know they do it. This is because most people do not understand how energy works, therefore they have no idea they are draining you of your energy. The people who understand how energy works and are also users of other people's energy are what I call ""Professional thieves"" meaning they actually purposely choose to use other people for energy. I had a friend at one time in my life who told me she would purposely ""steal"" other people's energy and feed off of other people energetically. I asked her how she did it and she said, ""with her mind"". She said she would pull people to her intentionally just with her thoughts and by just someone paying attention to her, she could take their energy. I asked: so a person has to be paying attention to you?, and she said yes, by them paying attention to me, they give me their energy. This makes a lot of sense, because whatever people focus on, they tend to give their energy to. I later found myself always tired and drained around this ""friend"".Whenever we have a relationship or interaction with another human, the other human we are having the relationship with or interaction will either function on two levels.The first level is the giver level, this is a person who does not have any type of hidden agenda or desire to control or have power over others. This level is how people should function with one another. This level is what is right and respectful within the universe as the way you are ""supposed"" to operate as a human being. Within the universe humans are supposed to be beings who ""share"" their energy with each other, and not take one another's energy and not give back anything in return.The giver is a person who is connected to the ""light"" as they say, meaning, this person has a connection to his or her own inner power/soul and has no need to use other people for energy, because they can develop their own energy. This is how you are ""supposed"" to function as a human being.The giver has an energy field ( aura ) which develops its own energy and in turn gives that energy to others.The second level is the user/abuser and taker level.The user is the human who has chosen to dominate, control, have power over, or manipulate one another as a way to compensate for his or her own lack of power, understanding and soul. The user may be completely unaware of his or her actions and functions on ""automatic pilot"", not really knowing who they are and why they operate the way they do.Some users understand more then others and actually purposely steal other people's power, energy and soul.The user tends to associate with other users and givers usually avoid these types of people. The user may be in high profile positions, such as teachers, healers, leaders, etc. The user is more common within the race of humans then the giver. This is due mostly to unhealthy choices and being spiritually dis-connected to ones own power and soul. The user tends to operate under fear, which is due to his or her own lack of power, understanding, and higher consciousness. The user functions at a level at which non-physical beings of a dark nature function at, which is a level of over powering one another, dominating one another, or attempting to control one another.The user has an energy field ( aura ) which is reversed, meaning it does not develop its own energy, but instead it gets its energy from outside of itself, from other people.As we deal with one another in a social or sexual relationship, we exchange energies completely unseen by the naked eye. When a user operates with another user there is very little power lost or stolen between the two people as they are both users and operating at the same level.When a user operates with a giver, there is an imbalance of energy exchanges. What this means is the user cannot give or exchange energy because of his or her lack of power, while the giver tends to ""give"" energy to the other person which is the user. So this imbalance creates a unhealthy relationship between the two people, as one person takes and the other person gives. As the relationship develops the user can actually steal whole parts of power or soul from the other person who is a giver. These parts of power or soul that are stolen from the giver are usually unknown to them because of their lack of understanding of how the soul functions on an energy level in regards to ""Soul Loss"". As parts of personal power are stolen they create openings or holes in the energy field. Once a person begins to develop holes in his or her energy field they are ""energetically vulnerable"" meaning they have power missing from them which in turn has caused them to be open energetically to non-physical beings. The attachment of non-physical beings in a persons energy field is what causes a person to develop lower levels of consciousness, energy, and power. The more power a person has stolen from another person, the more power is lost from that person and the more energetically vulnerable that person becomes.It is important to understand that we are not living in a world that is made of kind and loving beings, although you may believe you are. The darker truth of life is that this world we live in is made mostly of fear based beings, lower level humans, and dark consciousness. For if we lived in a loving world there would be no need to fight, battle, have power over each other, start wars, or hurt one another.The fact that humans have lived for thousands of years, and have created nothing but sickness, pain and misery within one another is only an example of how humans operate on a deeper level.Now, I believe there is a time for change. That we must understand what is wrong in order to fix it.That we must choose to understand who we are, and learn to make the choice to not live in fear, or give our power to others, or allow fear and lower level energy into our lives.Until we understand that there is no more need for fear, or pain or misery we will never change.To make the choice to become spiritually intelligent is to understand who we really are.Who we are is not a living breathing human being, but we are much more then that. We are soul beings, trapped in a physical body until we make the choice to leave this world.So when a person comes to you to steal your power, what are you going to say to them?No! You cannot steal my power, go get your own energy and power and stop using other people for your own personal benefit. When we make the choice to not allow others to use us, we choose to become self-empowered through our own choices to not allow other people to make us sick.Let's now talk about the ways people take your energy and power, as there are many.1. The Eyes, and Your Body Position when speaking to someone.The eyes are an important tool for transferring energy. The eyes have been called the 'window of the soul' for a reason. We can give and take energy through the eyes. If someone needs you to focus on them, you will need to look at them. When people look at something they are focusing on what they are looking at, giving it energy and attention. Whatever you focus on you give your energy to. Also the body and the position of the body is very important. Standing directly in front of energy vampires is giving them direct access to your heart chakra and center of your being. It is this position of your body which is not beneficial when speaking to people who absorb others energy. So when talking to someone who uses others for their energy try to not make eye contact with them, or face them directly.2. ConflictPeople who use others for energy will need you to focus on them and feed them. This is how most energy feeding is done. So what they will do is get you to fight them, argue with them, play their emotional and power stealing games. They will feed off your emotional reaction. They will attempt to get you to ""play"" their game by reacting. They will feed off the energy fed into the conflict. The easiest (and oldest) way to steal someone's energy and power is to start an argument or conflict with them and feed off their reaction. So when someone starts to begin some sort of conflict with you, you need to examine whether it is worth your energy to ""fight back"". Some battles are best dealt with by walking away and saying NO.3. Name Calling, Gossip, Emotional AttacksPeople will need to get you to react emotionally and feel hurt to give away your power. People need you to focus your mind on them and what they are manipulating you with. So what better of a way then to call you a name or emotionally attack you in some way? Mostly all power games revolve around making you feel hurt, or embarrassed, or weak, or powerless. So this method involves various acts of demoting your quality of being. Treating you in a way that hurts your emotional self.4. People Treating You As If You Are Of No Worth; Power and Domination GamesAnother similar tactic is to attempt to treat you like you are of low worth, or someone who lacks a certain skill or quality. The way a ""boss"" has power over his employees is to treat them like they are beneath him, and if the employees accept his beliefs they give away a certain amount of power. The way parents have power over their children is to keep them held down with limiting beliefs such as ""you're not good enough"", or ""you will never attain that"". Limiting beliefs is another way to steal someone's power.5. Talking Too Much, Asking Redundant or Pointless QuestionsA very simple and common way to use others for energy is to ask them pointless questions.You need to get someone to give you their energy, so getting them to talk or listen to you talk nonstop is an effective method. A person will come up and ask ""Do you know where the supermarket is"", when the supermarket is right across the street or they very well know exactly where it is. Or they will talk, and talk, and talk, about anything, it does not have to be a dumping of negativity, it can just be listening to them speak on end. The more you listen, the more energy you give away, the more they get you to talk, the more energy you give away.6. Trying To Be The Center Of AttentionSome people when they walk into a room talk extremely loud and attempt to make their presence known. This is a subtle energy feeding method which is designed to draw your attention to them, thereby focusing on them, which gives them energy. People who constantly need to be paid attention to have severe inner issues of needing love and attention from others. This is what little children do when they do not get what they want, they cry and create drama. Don't allow people to come into your life and force you to pay attention to them if they are not deserving of your attention.7. Dumping Negative or Emotional or Heavy Crap On YouRelated to number 4, is dumping heavy or emotional stuff on you. Negativity is very draining, so a person can sit and talk about their problems, and how this is going wrong, and how life is so hard, and on and on and before you know it you are drained, and they walk away feeling uplifted because they just fed off your light by dumping their dark crap on you. Again, having boundaries with people is the lesson.8. Emotional or Heavy RelationshipsAn emotional or heavy relationship is draining and some people seek out these types of relationships. Related to number 1, this relationship revolves around drama, pain, heavy emotions, and conflict. Constant arguing is a sure fire way to give away your energy and power. Understand that you could die at any moment and spending your time upset and bent out of shape because of a women or man you are in a relationship with is an extremely unhealthy existence. Avoid drama, or anything emotionally heavy at all costs.9. Sex/IntercourseOne of the easiest ways to drain someone else is through sex. Sex is not just a physical interaction, it is an energetic and spiritual interaction. The biggest ""feeders"" I have met used sex as their weapon of choice. Understand that if you are a ""giver"" of energy like so very few people are and you have sex with a ""feeder"" you are basically making a choice to give away your life force energy and power for a brief moment of physical pleasure. Now sex is not a bad thing, but if it starts to become draining, then you need to find another person to have that experience with. We did not come to this planet to give our power away to others, we came here to grow as a collective group of beings, and if the beings we are dealing with are not playing the same game as we are, we need to shift and change those relationships.10. Invasion of Personal Space/Being Very Close To Unhealthy PeopleThis is a little more advanced, but some people can feed off of you by just standing close to you. Since your energy field (aura) extends around your body in a distance of 5 feet give or take, those who are more experienced ""feeders"" will simply feed off your energy by standing close to you. You would not believe the amount of people who have tried to stand extremely close to me in order to feed off my aura. It is almost a joke. But this is what some due in order to steal your power and energy.11. At Distance Feeding aka ""Cording""Another more advanced method used by those who are highly skilled is to focus their feeding from a distance. Yes some people can actually feed off your energy psychically by using their mind and focusing on ""cording"" with you. ""Cords"" work by very thin thread like energetic cords (almost like tentacles) being connected to you to feed off you. Some people can project their cords from a distance to you and suck and steal energy from you. You usually have to be within eye distance of them, but it can be done and it is done on a daily by those who are more skilled at using others for energy.12. Psychic CordsUnlike normal energy ""cords"", psychic cords are a psychic connection you have with another person. You may constantly have dreams with a particular person, or you may constantly think about another person. You may think about someone and speak to them and they said they just thought about you. These are psychic connections and some of them are unhealthy because the people we are connected with ""psychically"" are unhealthy. If you are psychically connected to someone who is unhealthy, they can absorb some of your energy and power through dreams and other methods of psychic interaction.13. Violence, Fear, Anger and IntimidationAn extreme way of stealing another person's power is to attempt to intimidate them or physically attack them, for if someone is coming at you to hurt you, you will have no choice but to fight back and defend yourself. It is this defending yourself that will drain you. It is the heavy emotional crap you will go through while defending yourself that will drain you. It is the fear you feel when someone attempts to threaten you with physical harm that will drain you. Fear and anger are one in the same, so if someone gets you angry and upset at them that anger will drain you. These are all the extremely deceptive and manipulative ways some people use to steal our power. So be careful with who attempts to scare or hurt you. Defense is necessary in some instances but not all. The warrior way is to avoid conflict at all costs, and walking away is sometimes the best defense. Fear no one, unless you like being afraid. Fear is extremely dis-empowering and it is the greatest tool of all to steal another person's power and energy. If you could get everyone to fear you, what a great master of dis-empowerment you would be. But people choose to be afraid. It is a learned response and choice common among people who are not in their power. People can also project their fears and anger and negative emotions on to you as a sort of psychic attack and that will drain you as well. Learn to be in your power and develop emotional control and you will respond less and less to life with fear.Author's Bio:Peter Michael is a angel healer, clairsentient, clairaudient, and teacher of energy clearing work.His website is: entity attachment-----This post goes out to anyone who can relate toall the energy stealers and emotional vampires,and to the online cyberstalkers who are the perfect example.There's many of them here but the newest addition makes it seemthat you've had an involvement with them you've never had.In fact, you have never met them, have no interest in them,no association with them via email or otherwise.They contact you via posts and email as if you're someone else andfollow your ads and respond to cyberstalk you as if you're someone else.They also want to make it ""appear"" to others that you're a character intheir life when you don't know any of the people whatsoever. LOLThese are people you know nothing about outside of their ads.It's meant to embroil and rob your energy. It's a sickness.I've never lived in Queens, am not fat,don't have a carrot top or corkscrew curls, don't follow around any man or woman, am totally uninterested in and have never had an affair. I believe that women should protect other women.I would never knowingly step on anyone's toes. I believe that kindness breeds kindness. If you dislike how someone is treating you, don't allow them a place in your life. It's a choice. If any of you are real GO to the actual person.Stop making contact via anonymous email and responsesto MCs as if you know someone when you don't.Your blind responses don't prove that you know the person,it proves that you're a lunatic. If there's a real person,reach that person via a direct means via their actual email accountfrom your email account, via their actual phone number, or in person.Stop dragging strangers into your drama.Everyone knows your game now.It's over.If you're actually in pain from someone hurting youthen you too can apply the knowledge of this writingrather than making it seem that I am the cause of your wrathwhen I don't even know you!!!Stop the ambiguity.If you're seeking to call someone outat the very least use a first name and last initialso it's not just another Casper the Friendly(or Not So Friendly) Ghost.Stop contacting strangers.Reach the actual parties IF they exist.Stop responding to the ads of strangersas if you know them when you don't.It's a sickness.Your contact will now fall on deaf earsoutside of legal counsel who will takenecessary legal action to stop your cyberstalkingand abuse if you don't immediately cease and desist.If you have a REAL beef with someone who has wronged you,REACH THEM IN-PERSON, VIA PHONE, OR DIRECT EMAIL ADDRESSwith REAL NAMES, or speak with a therapist to gain closure.Stop contacting strangers via anon cl relay and addresses which are meaningless to themto dump your baggage. Stop distorting the intent of an ad to obtain a negative reaction.Stop malicious flagging which leads to inappropriate removal of the adand then inquire why the ad is being overposted within less than 48 hrs.or then imply that something must be suspicious about it when the onlything that is suspect is you!!!Stop trying to gain attention where it's not willingly offered.Stop trying to get free therapy online where it's not offered.Stop sending unsolicited, *cyberstalking email which havezero to do with genuinely meeting the clear request of the adand everything to do with harassment.Stop the envy. It seems pretty clear that when you place yourprejudice and bias on the ads of a stranger to flag them when the adsperfectly respect the TOU of the site while you allow others which are in clear violation to remain that it you who is questionable.Stop placing personal value judgments on platonic ads whichare perfectly platonic given the definition that CL provides when an ad is placed.If it's not for you, this doesn't mean the ad isn't perfectly suitable to someone else. Skip it.Stop with the reverse sexism in which you permit platonic ads by males,but flag comparable ads by females. It's judgmental and wrong.Strictly platonic is clearly defined at the site, not by your personal judgments.Stop maliciously following and obsessing over ads to whichyou're clearly unwilling and/or unable to respect contentalthough the ads meet the definition presented by CL for the category.Skip the ad and find one more suitable to your taste.You don't choose what's right for another's lifeand your attempts to control a stranger who couldnot care less about your opinion is cyberstalking.Note, I've never been a judgmental person.I can have a difference of opinion or preference and coexistwith others who seek something different. I'm not coming foryou unless you come for me. I'm referring to the actionsof the *cyberstalker and harasser who attempts to controlthe choices of a stranger. It's a crime.Place your own ad requesting what it is that you needso you connect with someone interested, orchoose one of the ads or an online forum which has offered it to youif you really are that in need of help or friendship and have no one to turn to,but stop taking out your loneliness, boredom and aggression on otherswho have nothing to do with it. It's wrong.Learn to be social in real life where someone can see who they're talking toand know if they're comfortable around you. If you can't respect the clearrequest of an ad and/or you're uncomfortable with its content to the point thatyou feel the need to place the person behind the ad on the defensive,but nevertheless choose to make contact, you're a *cyberstalker.#STOPIf you can't take the above advice, you will be talking to yourself,perhaps with garnished wages or locked up in a jail cell.Your actions are IN VIOLATION OF PROHIBITED OF TERMS OF USE,AND HAVE YOU CLASSIFIED AS A *CYBERSTALKER.This is the term used under criminal law to refer to your actions.Post-note, I'm not referring to someone warm, sincerely kind, complimentaryand supportive, I'm speaking of the individuals making contact to instigateand trigger drama and negative attention, an overall negative reaction,those who totally ignore what you've requested in the ad as if it was never stated,and/or clearly distort what you've requested or take it out of context to haveit appear misleading and attempt to place you on the defensive while generallypassing negative judgments and seeking to stir up negative attention and drama,not seeking to meet the clear request of the ad in a simple, direct, and transparent manner.Don't come for me and I won't come for you.You started this.I was just going about my personal and private business,leading my life seeking only compatible, pleasant, transparent interactions.My life energy has been returned to me for a positive, constructive purpose.Anyone who is malicious or intends to bring me emotional or other pain or harmwill have it received tenfold. You and/or your descendants, family and offspringwill receive the harm you're intending to bring my way. It's a law of the Universe.If you don't immediately cease and desist, you'll also find yourself witha restraining order and criminal record.

Ha.You were all educated and civilized professionals -entrepreneur, previous spa owner, doctor, lawyer, architect, and professor.I've been back in New York City for a while.Now and again I'm reminded of these fun, carefree timesbefore I'd gotten so serious. But, I'd lost your contact informationto a damaged cellphone and changed my cellphone numbersince the last time we'd been in touch.You always used to reach out to me, but what happensif you tried calling or texting and received a wrong numberor the phone just rang? You'd perhaps figure that I'd movedabroad or even got married. Nope on both counts.There was a brief engagement.In the serious long shot that is the missed connection,I'm hoping that one of you finds this note and reaches out.If not, maybe I will meet someone new who will be polished,but just as fun, pleasant to be around, open and nonjudgmentalto consider an unconventional, fun yet civilized way of meeting.I'm a pretty, sweet, smart, educated Caucasian-Americanwith long silky hair and slender, proportionate curves.I've been told many times that I'm not the type you'dexpect to find online, particularly here. The nature ofmy goals finds me spending far too many hours at my desk.How about you?If being trained to provide at-home spa servicesappeals to you, or you're already knowledgeablein spa services and are in a position to handle thecost of the secure location to host (I can arrange it)and a respectable gratuity for my time as a thank you,then I'd like to hear from you.The general premise isn't set in stone,it's just a starting point to establish some light,uncomplicated banter, relaxation and interactionand take it from there. Suggested contributionwill depend on the plan.Are you open to have me train you in spa services,such as facials, spa manicure and pedicure, and body treatments,or..are you seeking to cover a day of spa servicesand to accompany me to the spa and/or salonor..to meet up thereafter for social interaction?I'm open as long as you're attractive, pleasant,respectful, well-mannered and chivalrous.I'm attracted to gentlemen.Let's make this simple and funso that I know I'll be comfortable.Platonic, nonsexual and perfectly legal only.No improper expectations, please.Include email address, mobile number, general availability,what you have in mind and suggested contribution.It's 2016!! :)) Yippeee!!

I came to your office back in 2007 or so because I was having a dispute with my roommate. You were a free Pro Se attorney there and gave me advice on how to deal with her (in the Resource Room/Help Center, room 404 I believe). I remember you being kind of angry and bossy and impatient, not at me, just in general, like the job was driving you crazy. I could understand, given the circumstances and the ghetto, thuggish crowd you mostly deal with there (on that particular day I saw you, a black man with dreads in the elevator threatened to ""shoot up the place"" because he didn't want to wait on line anymore and you called Security on him... another time I went a 20 something female accused some 70 year old woman of ""flirting with her man"" just because the older lady said excuse me as they formed a queue/line, and the young woman then threatened to beat her up. Ridiculous stuff like that.. You were one of the most intense people I've ever met...You were impeccably dressed in a navy blue suit, a fit white male with dark, dark brown hair and beautiful cheekbones to match intensely blue eyes.

Last sunset on mainland for 2015. People believe a new year can be something that can solve all the problems, that's not true, its actually just another day in life. A feel good feeling is what its all about. When you wake up next day, its just a date that changes, maybe you have a day off, maybe not, nothing else is different. I believe that people always have choices, but they end up taking the easy route in most of the cases, many reasons for that, I do that too, everyone does that.There is hope, light, and a beautiful future ahead for everyone, sometimes you need to make hard choices, choices that may appear not right, but they are. Remember, its just another day.YOLO is not my theory, its YLED, that's what my belief is, 'You Live Every Day' enjoy every moment and every day of the rest of your life, you don't need and excuse of new year or birthday or mothers/fathers day. Love everyone everyday, every moment, because you live every day, the moment you have lived it, it becomes history. So live EVERY DAY :)love and be loved is what makes the world go round. Smile, be the ray of light, be a positive energy, spread love, believe in self, hug someone, help someone, make a difference in someone's life, feed someone, the smile on their face gives me the joy and that's what I follow.Because that is me, and I believe in me :)",40.617900,-73.985600,2016-01-04 03:39:21.219232,2016-01-04 03:39:21.219232,detail page

Every night when I go to bed, I think of you, and every morning when I wake up, I count the hours left till we meet again. Often weeks go by without me seeing you, because I have no control over my dreams. But every moment of my day is filled with the constant barrage of thoughts about you and how you inspire me to become something more. You are my inspiration, the one who makes me soar through the skies with passion. You are my Pandora's box, filled to the brim with only hurt and pain of being apart, and yet, motivating me to make something more of myself so that one day you may see me in a new light. When you were real to me, I made a mistake, and because of that, you lost all respect for me. It was difficult for you to even look upon me, and it tore every fiber of my being to shreds. Because you were more important to me than you could ever imagine. My princess, my moon and stars, my universe. I wish you knew how much I want to hold your hand and look into your eyes and tell you that you are everything to me... I wish you knew that I would sacrifice my life to see you smile, to have you smile at me, knowing that I would rather die than cause you an ounce of pain, and that I would bear every ounce of pain you caused me, as long as I knew that you were happy, that you were in my arms, and that the world couldn't hurt you as long as I held you close. My eyes shed tears of sorrow and pain, because you are nothing more than a dream, a memory. And like all memories, as the days pass, you slowly fade away, leaving behind nothing more in me than an empty shell. What am I to do? Who am I to become? Please, forgive me for what I've done, come back to me. Let me give you my life, my heart, my soul.

We've been there for each other through the happiest days, the hardest moments and, you know, we're that much the better for it. Once, decades ago, back in high school, you held my head and ran your fingers through my hair when I had too much to drink at that summer party senior year when we were busy marking the beginning of our futures with bright hopeful exclamations. Twice, I've driven like mad into Brooklyn at the drop of a hat to pull you from the depths of that clawing depression that closes in around you when you find yourself trembling with fear at the questions you ask yourself- if you've done the right things with your life, made the right choices. I remember when you guided me home that night my psychosis came back and I found myself lost in some dim corner of an East Village bar with my mind transforming the entire pulsing city into a weapon and the Saturday crowds whispering hallucinatory nothings that swirled around me like so much hateful smoke. And I've been there for you through the pain of walking backwards along the path of your own footprints, wondering if you're ever going to go somewhere, if you'll ever escape that corporate purgatory that makes your stomach turn or rise from the dull glow of that nameless oblivion that you wish your music will one day lift you out of. We've saved each other a thousand times. We've laughed together a thousand more. We've spent entire nights talking about the things we'd never share with anyone else. We've shared a thousand meals and wondered simultaneously at a thousand ancient questions. It began as a tiny twinkle somewhere. It grew and grew until I couldn't ignore it. And I remember the exact moment when I realized that I love you more than anything else in this universe and all the parallel universes too. There was classical music on the radio and it was autumn. In one crystalline second everything just clicked into place as if all the stars fell from the sky into my cupped hands which I held out like a beggar's bowl. But I didn't want to destroy what we had so instead, I wrote you a love letter which I kept in my jacket pocket for years, half waiting for the right moment to give it to you and half keeping it with me with the intention of never giving it, just letting it smolder there somewhere near my heart where it belonged. There was even one night when I reached for a cigarette and the envelope crinkled and you asked me what I had in there. I muttered something about receipts and looked at my shoes. When the moment actually came, when I built up the courage and you read my letter, you knew you could never love me back. It's just the way things are. I guess you just don't get to pick who your heart belongs to. And so we chose to stay friends. And I refused to bring it up ever again because I'd rather swallow my heart than lose you as a friend, or pressure you, or make you uncomfortable. I suppose I've always loved you, and I always will. More than I can describe in any letter. More than you could ever know. But a part of you does know- and I think we both wish things could be different, but they can't - and sometimes the sadness of it threatens to pull me apart bone by bone. Sometimes, when we smile at each other, I can almost pretend we are together. And so I write this to you knowing you will never see it. I should forget you. I should leave and never look back. But I can't. Because last week when you called me sobbing hysterically and I went on the rescue mission of my lifetime to lift you up from the darkness that had crept up from the edges of your life I realized that my love for you, although it can never be returned, does make a difference. And I want you to know, when you worry about nobody loving you, when those whispers of despair worm their way into your mind, that as long as I am here you will never be unloved. We may grow apart eventually. We'll marry other people and have long lives in distant places. But I will always love you the most. And this city will remember, long after we are both gone. It's soaked into the streets. It's floating above the waters. It's drifting between the brownstones. It's etched, in a subtle but forever way, into the grand history of New York.

So as always, I am left all alone with nothing to do and no one to be with on NYE... idk why im posting here, no one ever replies... but i guess it feels better to write about it. Before I go, can I tell you about the nature of burdens? As we go forward with our lives, a lot of us are like vacuum cleaners, sucking up the pieces of pain and anguish and adding it onto our burden basket which we carry on our backs... the people we've hurt, the ones we've lost out of sheer stupidity, and we end up looking at the basket we carry, unable to let them go... sometimes these shards sneak out of the holes in our baskets, and slice their way into our hearts, as though our hearts were magnetic, and the pain, shards of iron. What we are left with in the real world is a list of people we'd rather not even have in our lives... because the ones that matter are gone. What if we had a time machine that we could use not for any other reason but to right the wrongs we've made in our lives against the people that mattered? What if we could go back in time and get rid of the people we used to be and take their place, and instead of ignoring the moments that mattered like the predecessor, we took hold of the ones we loved, and told them how much they mattered, that the world wouldnt be as beautiful or as bright if they werent in it... its unfortunate that only after the ones who we love are gone, does the world become dimmer, as though mocking the fact that we cannot go back and make things right... I wish the world wasn't so. I wish the world was on our side. I wish I could tell someone I loved, that I loved them, that my life wasnt worth living without them, that the days are bleaker, the nights longer, and the pain, unbearable. Without the ones we love, why do we bother to live? I suppose it is because most of us are incapable of taking our own lives for one reason or another... An off button would be nice. After all, why would a man with nothing to lose, see death as such a crucible?",40.7127837,-74.0059413,2016-01-04 03:41:15.795381,2016-01-04 03:41:15.795381,Google Places API

Why do you still care for me so, when many others gave up and let go? I look for you among the shadows, praying that you're there, but it was just my imagination, i never met you anywhere. You were loyal to me all the time, never cheated, never lied, the problem is you're an imaginary guy. You got to know me, learned what i loved, i swore you were an angel from above. Next thing i know, it begins to rain, i wake up on the wrong stop of a subway train. So what if you dont exist, i have no shame, im a victim of the dating games.

5898,5378502275,Ballet Flats $Shoeplay$$ - m4w,2015-12-28 20:49,/mnh/mis/5378502275.html,mnh,m4w,Financial District,"LADIESDO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME, THE MAN POSTING ABOUT PAYING TO WATCH YOU WEAR BALLET FLATS IN PUBLIC DOES NOT PAY. The ad he posts looks like this: --I am a guy who has a serious fetish for women's flats. I love to see a woman cross her legs and playfully dangle the flat off of her foot, playing with it. I love it soo much I'm willing to pay upwards of 350$ an hour to schedule a time to watch you do this. We can meet in public (always public for both our concerns) and you can study or whatever and I'll discreetly watch your natural dangle.If you are interested, please be ready to send pictures of your flats (as I need to see if your flats are of my preference) I like older, well worn, used flats btw :) but really I'm a sucker for all ballet/ballerina flats...pointy toe, almond toe... I love them. and please let me know your height/weight, race, and shoe size.Please provide your personal email address as well, as CL emails sometimes get blocked or pinned as SPAM. Thank you and hope to speak soon !!--I needed extra cash and responded to the ad, it sounded extremely simple. First of all, he does not want to meet you in a public cafe, he tried to meet in a movie theatre. I refused and met at a cafe instead. Although his ad calls for discretion and public meeting, he will ask you to move to the most quiet area of the public place, with the least amount of people around. So basically it's just the two of you, separated by about 15ft., with a few passersby now and then. Studying is not really an option as he will ask you to constantly be playing with your flats and tell you you're wasting time otherwise. I never looked him in the face or directly at him, but I am 99% sure he started masturbating right there. Before the end of the hour he asked me to report him to security, and arranged that we'd do the payment by him leaving it in a book, I'd pick it up, and then report him to security afterwards. He communicates via email. In the preliminary email conversation, he outlined the rate for my flats for one hour, and a long list of rules he follows. It very much seemed like a set system he had in place, and that he was looking to do this on a consistent weekly basis. He said he pays at the end of a ""session"" by putting money in an envelope inside a book or magazine, and leaving that next to you. The day of, before the end of the hour, he left abruptly, asked me to meet him back inside the cafe, and then claimed to have been escorted out by security because someone else reported him, all within a 3min time span. He claimed they were calling the police and asked me to leave the building and not speak to anyone, and that he'd email later. After that he gets completely ghost. SO : EITHER DEMAND PAYMENT UPFRONT, OR DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. I should've known better, but let my experience save you from wasting your time.",40.718500,-74.002500,2016-01-04 03:44:32.812627,2016-01-04 03:44:32.812627,detail page

You told me you were a born and raised New Yorker of Mexican/Honduran descent, newly wed, living and working in Manhattan. Something drew me to direct message you though we had never met. You said your name was Maria. You would later tell me that you had never had any desire to converse with someone you didn't know, but that I had been just charismatic enough (you'd insert a winking emoticon here), to piqued your interest. We spoke late into that night, the following night, and the night after that.We quickly grew close. Every additional conversation was a new discovery in how amazingly well we meshed together. We both had never meet another person that we instantly felt like we had known forever. You loved Aaliyah, the Yankees, and chamomile tea. You loved reading and told me you would be surrounded with Orchids at all times if it were possible. You teased me about being a silly country boy who was much too proud of the bad Spanish he picked up during Peace Corps service and found my love of 90's New York hip hop amusing for someone that had grown up on a road named after a part of a farm animal's anatomy. I teased you about your obsession with the discontinued Johnson's Body Care - Melt Away Stress Lavender & Chamomile Body Wash and the tattoo you got on your right hip at twenty that read ""fire and ice"" in Chinese characters. When you revealed to me shortly thereafter you several months pregnant, I felt like I somehow already knew.You had gotten married to your on again/off again boyfriend you had known for several years. You had found out he was cheating, separated, gotten back together, discovered you were pregnant, and agreed to marry. You had hope it would led to better things. It had not. You said he showed less interest in being a husband or a father seemingly by the day. I learned most nights would find you sleeping on small couch after some fight or argument as he slumbered in the apartment's queen-size bed. You had decided shortly before we met you would move out as soon after you had the baby. You had miscarried before and were scared. Your mother, who I would come to learn had been your absolute everything, had passed recently and unexpectedly from a stroke at 52. It was very hard for you to speak about your father.We had agreed early on to keep our correspondence quiet. You were worried it it might negatively affect any divorce settlement agreement and needed every penny possible to move out. You wanted to take these next steps on your own with no help from anyone. Whenever I attempted to offer any money or assistance, you would tell me you only need my time, love, and patience. I named the little girl in your growing belly ""Melon,"" because you constantly craved melon as she grew bigger and bigger. You jokingly insisted her middle name was going to be Melon until I wasn't sure if you were joking anymore. You were excited to be a mother. You begin talking about finding a job in Atlanta and bringing yourself and little Melon down south to start over. We'd giggle over the idea of orchid-filled weddings and that beautiful shiny antique vintage wedding ring you had saw an elderly woman wearing on the L one day. I had never felt more excited or hopeful about the future. We were in love.Melon came too early and didn't survive. You moved in with your older sister in the Bronx. We mourned together. You struggled. I fought with you to see a professional to help you work through things. You had gone earlier in life and disliked the process immensely. I worried about more and more about you, both with issues I have mentioned here and others I have not. The dark days became increasingly frequent and were beginning to be the norm and not the exception. In your most soberest moment, you revealed you wish you could go to sleep and not wake up. This terrified me. I felt you slipping away.The last I heard from you was September 22nd (or possibly the 25th) of 2013. You sent me and email reading: ""Sorry. I'll talk to you soon. I'm alright."" Days turned into weeks and I began to worry. Weeks turned months and I feared the worst. I continue to do everything I can to find you. Last year through a miracle I still don't quite understand, I was able to somehow locate your sister's apartment in the Bronx. Within a few days, I had flown to the New York for the first time and found myself on the stoop in front of your sister's building on Rochambeau Avenue in the Bronx. Several people in the building including your neighbors recognized you, but didn't know you or your sister beyond an occasional hello. The apartment had been vacated some months before. The building management had no additional info. I spent the next several days in New York tracking down any and every lead I could, but ultimately came up with only dead ends.I hope you're out there.

To some it is a need or a simple relaxing ""bonus"" pleasure, to get off and release after a good workout like it is to sit in the steam room/sauna. But as they say it is kind of hit or miss for most of you. Proof of the fact, that the missed connection section on CL is so full of ads. Most of the guys who are really horny and are lucky enough to find that days most hottest guy to fool around with, go home, or back to work pissed off, if the opportunity didn't present itself to the full extent they wanted. Here is where I come in with the comic part. I will recount today's observation of events at NYSC Park Slope from my point of view and you go ahead and take the pointers anyway you want, but my goal is to make you see the comedy of it all and instead of going home pissed make a joke out of it, and maybe you'll behave differently while cruising at the gym next time. Most of the guys cruising expect a drama free, quick, anonymous hookup with no hassle. But in fact the subconscious mind games going on is so freakin dramatic, like women are. I spent a couple of hours and this is what I took in. At times there were 4-8 people in the steam room or sauna, all of them wanting the same thing, ""instant gratification for little Johnny""! One guy might be into 2 or 3 others, yet he is waiting for another to leave the room. Almost no one has the guts to start the action, everyone looking around to wait for that specific person/s to leave and for someone to start playing with themselves. One guy runs out from the steam room hoping to get the sauna empty, all for himself, and hoping that only the guy/s will follow suite, or vice versa. Another runs out cause he can't handle the heat any longer. Others sit silently and try to will this guy out with their mind. People measure hotness and then become disappointed. I've seen guys with big bulges sticking out of their towel only to produce a 6-6.5, at the most, inch cock, while other with no bulge hide an 8-9 inch pecker beneath that towel. Many hot muscle guys have small cocks, while others not that hot looking have huge cocks. But people forget that books shouldn't be judged by its cover. I've seen a guy running away from another cause he wasn't into his looks, but at one point he caught a glimpse of his hard-on and decided to compromise.Guys don't realize how many times they could have a 6-10 people group jerk, oral, and more, while still choosing who they want to play with in the room. Instead some guys who think they are gods gifts, and they might be handsome, end up going home pissed, without any release, even though they are so perfectly hot, yet their ego, and picky attitude is their own downfall, for no pleasure. I don't blame them, trolls can be blamed just as well. Some might think, hey you are probably a troll complaining, but that is so far from the truth. I have had more hits then misses at the gym wet areas, for two reasons. First of all, I don't take it seriously. People might see me burst out laughing thinking that I'm crazy, while seeing the situation just makes me smile and laugh. Taking it easy, makes it all the more easier. Secondly, I know that there is no such thing as 100% perfection in this world. Very rarely does someone hookup with the perfect guy, in the perfect setting, with the perfect scenario. So once you are aware that the perfect moment will probably not present itself, one makes the best out of the current situation.I'm actually a nice guy who will not stalk a person if the signs are clear that they are not interested, I will walk in the opposite direction and give the guy his room to play. If for instance I walk in upon some guy fooling around, I will tell them to carry on and not mind me, cause the sooner they have their pleasure the sooner they'll be out of my way. But in reality most people are not like that, they tend to be selfish.I would recommend trolls to loosen up and not try to get something that they clearly will not get, why should the young hot guys not have pleasure because of your selfishness. Vice versa as well, you hot hunk/jock have fun in the room with the guy of your liking and let the other person not so hot feast his eyes and jerk off, without letting him touch you. You'll end up being satisfied and so will they.Guys have fun, make sure to have a lookout. Take it easy, see the comic part of it, and enjoy life and let others do the same. Good luck to y'all, and a happy New Year. ",40.666900,-73.982800,2016-01-04 03:46:07.958224,2016-01-04 03:46:07.958224,detail page
